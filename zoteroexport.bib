  abstract = {Electronic health records hold great promise for clinical and epidemiologic research. Undertaking atopic eczema (AE) research using such data is challenging because of its episodic and heterogeneous nature. We sought to develop and validate a diagnostic algorithm that identifies AE cases based on codes used for electronic records used in the UK Health Improvement Network. We found that at least one of five diagnosis codes plus two treatment codes for any skin-directed therapy were likely to accurately identify patients with AE. To validate this algorithm, a questionnaire was sent to the physicians of 200 randomly selected children and adults. The primary outcome, positive predictive value for a physician-confirmed diagnosis of AE, was 86\% (95\% confidence interval~= 80\textendash 91). Additional criteria increased the PPV up to 95\% but would miss up to 89\% of individuals with physician-confirmed AE. The first and last entered diagnosis codes for individuals showed good agreement with the physician-confirmed age at onset and last disease activity; the mean difference was 0.8 years (95\% confidence interval~= \textendash 0.3 to 1.9) and \textendash 1.3 years (95\% confidence interval~= \textendash 2.5 to \textendash 0.1), respectively. A combination of diagnostic and prescription codes can be used to reliably estimate the diagnosis and duration of AE from The Health Improvement Network primary care electronic health records in the UK.},

  abstract = {The term transgender youth commonly refers to those whose gender identity, or personal core sense of self as a particular gender, differs from their assigned sex at birth; this is often designated by what external genitalia are present. These youths are presenting to multidisciplinary clinics worldwide at exponentially higher rates than in decades past, and clinics themselves have grown in number to meet the specialized demands of these youth. Additionally, the scientific and medical community has moved towards understanding the construct of gender dimensionally (i.e., across a spectrum from male to female) as opposed to dichotomous or binary ``male or female'' categories. This is reflected in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM 5); in this publication, the diagnostic classification of gender dysphoria, GD, (which has two subtypes: childhood and adolescence/adulthood) provides a set of criteria that many transgender people meet. GD describes the affective distress that arises as a result of the incongruence between gender identity and sex anatomy. The DSM uses language to indicate that a person may identify as another gender instead of the other gender, which further captures the complexity of the human experience of gender. Also, research regarding how current adolescents are describing their identity development and experience along this spectrum within today's society is only now being addressed in the literature. Therefore, the clinical needs of the transgender population have outpaced medical training and scientific advancement, which has opened up gaps on how to define best practices. This article provides current concepts of evaluation and management for transgender persons with emphasis on hormonal therapy (i.e., puberty blockers and gender affirming hormone therapy). Other management issues are briefly considered including gender confirming surgery and changes in the face as well as voice.},

  abstract = {Introduction The number of adolescents referred to specialized gender identity clinics for gender dysphoria appears to be increasing and there also appears to be a corresponding shift in the sex ratio, from one favoring natal males to one favoring natal females. Aim We conducted two quantitative studies to ascertain whether there has been a recent inversion of the sex ratio of adolescents referred for gender dysphoria. Methods The sex ratio of adolescents from two specialized gender identity clinics was examined as a function of two cohort periods (2006\textendash 2013 vs. prior years). Study 1 was conducted on patients from a clinic in Toronto, and Study 2 was conducted on patients from a clinic in Amsterdam. Results Across both clinics, the total sample size was 748. In both clinics, there was a significant change in the sex ratio of referred adolescents between the two cohort periods: between 2006 and 2013, the sex ratio favored natal females, but in the prior years, the sex ratio favored natal males. In Study 1 from Toronto, there was no corresponding change in the sex ratio of 6,592 adolescents referred for other clinical problems. Conclusions Sociological and sociocultural explanations are offered to account for this recent inversion in the sex ratio of adolescents with gender dysphoria.

  abstract = {Transgender children and adolescents show high rates of co-occurring psychopathology, which might be related to low self-confidence. Earlier research showed that compared to the norm population, transgender clinic\textendash referred children have lower self-perception on two domains: physical appearance and global self-worth. This study aimed to compare self-perception in a sample of transgender clinic\textendash referred children and adolescents with their standardization samples and to examine differences between these two groups. To measure self-esteem, the Self-Perception Profile for Children was administered to 305 referred children (162 assigned males at birth (AMABs) and 143 assigned females at birth (AFABs), mean age\,=\,9.05 (SD, 1.47), range\,=\,5.9\textendash 13.00\,years), and the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents was administered to 369 referred adolescents (118 AMABs and 251 AFABs, mean age\,=\,15.27 (SD, 1.80), range\,=\,10.73\textendash 18.03\,years). To measure the severity of gender dysphoria, the parents of the children completed the Gender Identity Questionnaire and the adolescents completed the Utrecht Gender Dysphoria Scale. Referred children and adolescents had a significantly lower self-concept compared to the normative population, whereby referred adolescents felt less competent compared to referred children. Compared to their peers, childhood referred AFABs perceived themselves even better on scholastic and athletic competence and social acceptance. With regard to gender differences, referred AFABs generally showed a better self-perception compared to referred AMABs. The lower self-perception of transgender clinic\textendash referred children and adolescents compared to same age peers deserves clinical attention and interventions aimed at, for example, improving social and physical self-worth.},

  abstract = {All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, `kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

However, because these technologies can measure dozens of parameters simultaneously in individual cells, data interpretation can be challenging. Here we present viSNE, a tool that allows one to map high-dimensional cytometry data onto two dimensions, yet conserve the high-dimensional structure of the data. viSNE plots individual cells in a visual similar to a scatter plot, while using all pairwise distances in high dimension to determine each cell's location in the plot. We integrated mass cytometry with viSNE to map healthy and cancerous bone marrow samples. Healthy bone marrow automatically maps into a consistent shape, whereas leukemia samples map into malformed shapes that are distinct from healthy bone marrow and from each other. We also use viSNE and mass cytometry to compare leukemia diagnosis and relapse samples, and to identify a rare leukemia population reminiscent of minimal residual disease. viSNE can be applied to any multi-dimensional single-cell technology.},

  abstract = {This review summarizes recent evidence concerning hormonal and sex chromosome effects in obesity, atherosclerosis, aneurysms, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and hypertension. Cardiovascular diseases occur and progress differently in the 2 sexes, because biological factors differing between the sexes have sex-specific protective and harmful effects. By comparing the 2 sexes directly, and breaking down sex into its component parts, one can discover sex-biasing protective mechanisms that might be targeted in the clinic. Gonadal hormones, especially estrogens and androgens, have long been found to account for some sex differences in cardiovascular diseases, and molecular mechanisms mediating these effects have recently been elucidated. More recently, the inherent sexual inequalities in effects of sex chromosome genes have also been implicated as contributors in animal models of cardiovascular diseases, especially a deleterious effect of the second X chromosome found in females but not in males. Hormonal and sex chromosome mechanisms interact in the sex-specific control of certain diseases, sometimes by opposing the action of the other.},

Even though data produced from these technologies are proving to be the most informative of any thus far, very little attention has been paid to fundamental design aspects of data collection and analysis, namely sampling, randomization, replication, and blocking. We discuss these concepts in an RNA sequencing framework. Using simulations we demonstrate the benefits of collecting replicated RNA sequencing data according to well known statistical designs that partition the sources of biological and technical variation. Examples of these designs and their corresponding models are presented with the goal of testing differential expression.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify patterns of childhood adversity in a sample of adolescents and assess disparities in these experiences for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning adolescents and by level of gender nonconformity. METHOD By using the cross-sectional, statewide, anonymous 2016 Minnesota Student Survey, 81 885 students were included in the current study (50.59\% male; mean age = 15.51). Participants were enrolled in grades 9 and 11 in a total of 348 schools. RESULTS: Four patterns of childhood adversity were identified with sex-stratified latent class analyses (entropy = 0.833 males; 0.833 females), ranging from relatively low levels of abuse (85.3\% males; 80.1\% females) to polyvictimization (0.84\% males; 1.98\% females). A regression analysis showed that compared with heterosexual adolescents, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and questioning adolescents were more likely to be classified into profiles characterized by polyvictimization (odds ratio [OR] 1.81\textendash 7.53) and psychological and/or physical abuse (OR 1.29\textendash 3.12), than no or low adversity. Similarly, compared with nontransgender adolescents, transgender adolescents were more likely to be classified into profiles characterized by patterns of polyvictimization (OR 1.49\textendash 2.91) and psychological and/or physical abuse (OR 1.23\textendash 1.96). A higher level of gender nonconformity predicted a higher likelihood of being classified into each adversity profile compared with the no or low adversity profile (OR 1.14\textendash 1.45). CONCLUSIONS: Sexual minority adolescents and adolescents with high levels of gender nonconformity are vulnerable to experience adversity. The disparities for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning adolescents and adolescents with high gender nonconformity highlight the variation in patterns of childhood adversity that these youth are at risk of experiencing. The findings reveal the need for further research on the benefits and harm of screening for childhood adversity by physicians and pediatricians.},

The popular MEME motif discovery algorithm is now complemented by the GLAM2 algorithm which allows discovery of motifs containing gaps. Three sequence scanning algorithms\textemdash MAST, FIMO and GLAM2SCAN\textemdash allow scanning numerous DNA and protein sequence databases for motifs discovered by MEME and GLAM2. Transcription factor motifs (including those discovered using MEME) can be compared with motifs in many popular motif databases using the motif database scanning algorithm Tomtom. Transcription factor motifs can be further analyzed for putative function by association with Gene Ontology (GO) terms using the motif-GO term association tool GOMO. MEME output now contains sequence LOGOS for each discovered motif, as well as buttons to allow motifs to be conveniently submitted to the sequence and motif database scanning algorithms (MAST, FIMO and Tomtom), or to GOMO, for further analysis. GLAM2 output similarly contains buttons for further analysis using GLAM2SCAN and for rerunning GLAM2 with different parameters. All of the motif-based tools are now implemented as web services via Opal. Source code, binaries and a web server are freely available for noncommercial use at http://meme.nbcr.net.},

Most existing motif discovery algorithms do not scale well to such large datasets, or fail to report many motifs associated with cofactors of the ChIP-ed TF.Results: We present DREME, a motif discovery algorithm specifically designed to find the short, core DNA-binding motifs of eukaryotic TFs, and optimized to analyze very large ChIP-seq datasets in minutes. Using DREME, we discover the binding motifs of the the ChIP-ed TF and many cofactors in mouse ES cell (mESC), mouse erythrocyte and human cell line ChIP-seq datasets. For example, in mESC ChIP-seq data for the TF Esrrb, we discover the binding motifs for eight cofactor TFs important in the maintenance of pluripotency. Several other commonly used algorithms find at most two cofactor motifs in this same dataset. DREME can also perform discriminative motif discovery, and we use this feature to provide evidence that Sox2 and Oct4 do not bind in mES cells as an obligate heterodimer. DREME is much faster than many commonly used algorithms, scales linearly in dataset size, finds multiple, non-redundant motifs and reports a reliable measure of statistical significance for each motif found. DREME is available as part of the MEME Suite of motif-based sequence analysis tools (http://meme.nbcr.net).Contact: t.bailey@uq.edu.auSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here, we demonstrate that Top1 inhibition favors Pol II escape from a promoter-proximal pausing site of the human HIF-1alpha gene in living cells. Interestingly, alternative splicing at exon 11 was markedly altered in nascent HIF-1alpha mRNAs, and chromatin structure was also affected with enhanced histone acetylation and reduced nucleosome density in a manner dependent on cdk activity. Moreover, CPT increases transcription of a novel long RNA (5'aHIF1alpha), antisense to human HIF-1alpha mRNA, and a known antisense RNA at the 3'-end of the gene, while decreasing mRNA levels under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The effects require Top1, but are independent from Top1-induced replicative DNA damage. Chromatin RNA immunoprecipitation results showed that CPT can activate antisense transcription mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) activity. Thus, Top1 inhibition can trigger a transcriptional stress, involving antisense transcription and increased chromatin accessibility, which is dependent on cdk activity and deregulated Pol II pausing. A changed balance of antisense transcripts and mRNAs may then lead to altered regulation of HIF-1alpha activity in human cancer cells.},

Most methods for determining CNV rely on admixtures of cells, where information regarding genetic heterogeneity is lost. Here, we present a protocol that allows for the genome wide copy number analysis of single nuclei isolated from mixed populations of cells. Single nucleus sequencing (SNS), combines flow sorting of single nuclei based on DNA content, whole genome amplification (WGA), followed by next generation sequencing to quantize genomic intervals in a genome wide manner. Multiplexing of single cells is discussed. Additionally, we outline informatic approaches that correct for biases inherent in the WGA procedure and allow for accurate determination of copy number profiles. All together, the protocol takes \textasciitilde 3 days from flow cytometry to sequence-ready DNA libraries.},

  abstract = {Oxygen sensing revisited The cellular response to hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) is a contributing factor in many human diseases. Previous studies examining the way in which hypoxia alters gene expression have focused on oxygen-sensing enzymes that regulate the activity of a transcription factor called hypoxia-inducible factor (see the Perspective by Gallipoli and Huntly). Chakraborty et al. and Batie et al. now show that hypoxia can also affect gene expression through direct effects on chromatin regulators. Certain histone demethylases, such as KDM6A and KDM5A, were found to be direct sensors of oxygen. In cell-culture models, hypoxia diminished the activity of these enzymes and caused changes in the expression of genes that govern cell fate. Science, this issue p. 1217, p. 1222; see also p. 1148 Oxygen is essential for the life of most multicellular organisms. Cells possess enzymes called molecular dioxygenases that depend on oxygen for activity. A subclass of molecular dioxygenases is the histone demethylase enzymes, which are characterized by the presence of a Jumanji-C (JmjC) domain. Hypoxia can alter chromatin, but whether this is a direct effect on JmjC-histone demethylases or due to other mechanisms is unknown. Here, we report that hypoxia induces a rapid and hypoxia-inducible factor\textendash independent induction of histone methylation in a range of human cultured cells. Genomic locations of histone-3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K36me3 after a brief exposure of cultured cells to hypoxia predict the cell's transcriptional response several hours later. We show that inactivation of one of the JmjC-containing enzymes, lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A), mimics hypoxia-induced cellular responses. These results demonstrate that oxygen sensing by chromatin occurs via JmjC-histone demethylase inhibition. Certain chromatin regulators can directly sense changes in oxygen levels, leading to changes in gene expression.

Results from Phase I of the Trans PULSE Project, a community-based research project in Ontario, Canada, are presented. Based on qualitative data from focus groups with 85 trans community members, a theoretical framework describing how erasure functions to impact experiences interacting with the health care system was developed. Two key sites of erasure were identified: informational erasure and institutional erasure. How these processes work in a mutually reinforcing manner to erase trans individuals and communities and produce a system in which a trans patient or client is seen as an anomaly is shown. Thus, the impetus often falls on trans individuals to attempt to remedy systematic deficiencies. The concept of cisnormativity is introduced to aid in explaining the pervasiveness of trans erasure. Strategies for change are identified.},

  abstract = {Objective To report on the findings of a systematic review which examined the experiences and views of older people aged 65 years and over on health professionals' recognition of sexuality and sexual health and whether these aspects of the person are incorporated into care. Review methods The review followed the methods laid out by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Eleven electronic databases were searched using the terms sexual*, aged, ageing/aging, attitudes and care in any health-care setting. Only quantitative and qualitative research and opinion papers written in English and offering unique commentary published between January 2004 and January 2015 were eligible. Results A total of 999 papers were initially identified and of these, 148 were assessed by two reviewers. Eighteen studies \textendash{} seven quantitative, eight qualitative and three opinion papers \textendash{} met the inclusion criteria and were appraised. The importance of sexuality to well-being, language used, expressing sexuality, discomfort discussing sexuality, inadequate sexuality health education and treatment and deficient communication with health-care professionals were all identified as significant issues in a range of settings. Fourteen categories and five syntheses summarize the 43 findings. Conclusions Sexuality remains important for many older people; however, embarrassment, dissatisfaction with treatment, negative attitudes and seeming disinterest by health professionals can all inhibit discussions. Professionals and health-care services need to adopt strategies and demonstrate characteristics which create environments that are more supportive of sexuality. Issues related to sexuality and sexual health should be able to be discussed without anxiety or discomfort so that older people receive optimal care and treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the magnitude of mental health problems, particularly life-threatening ones, experienced by transgender and/or gender nonconforming (TGNC) youth can lead to improved management of these conditions. METHODS: Electronic medical records were used to identify a cohort of 588 transfeminine and 745 transmasculine children (3\textendash 9 years old) and adolescents (10\textendash 17 years old) enrolled in integrated health care systems in California and Georgia. Ten male and 10 female referent cisgender enrollees were matched to each TGNC individual on year of birth, race and/or ethnicity, study site, and membership year of the index date (first evidence of gender nonconforming status). Prevalence ratios were calculated by dividing the proportion of TGNC individuals with a specific mental health diagnosis or diagnostic category by the corresponding proportion in each reference group by transfeminine and/or transmasculine status, age group, and time period before the index date. RESULTS: Common diagnoses for children and adolescents were attention deficit disorders (transfeminine 15\%; transmasculine 16\%) and depressive disorders (transfeminine 49\%; transmasculine 62\%), respectively. For all diagnostic categories, prevalence was severalfold higher among TGNC youth than in matched reference groups. Prevalence ratios (95\% confidence intervals [CIs]) for history of self-inflicted injury in adolescents 6 months before the index date ranged from 18 (95\% CI 4.4\textendash 82) to 144 (95\% CI 36\textendash 1248). The corresponding range for suicidal ideation was 25 (95\% CI 14\textendash 45) to 54 (95\% CI 18\textendash 218). CONCLUSIONS: TGNC youth may present with mental health conditions requiring immediate evaluation and implementation of clinical, social, and educational gender identity support measures.},

At the same time, it has been our clinical impression that the psychological vulnerability of at least some of these youth has been overlooked. Fifty consecutive referrals of adolescents with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID) constituted the sample. Information obtained at intake was coded for the presence or absence of 15 psychosocial and psychological vulnerability factors. The mean number of psychosocial/psychological vulnerability factors coded as present was 5.56 (range, 0\textendash 13). Over half of the sample had six or more of the vulnerability factors. The number of factors coded as present was significantly correlated with behavioral and emotional problems on the Youth Self-Report Form and the Child Behavior Checklist, but not with demographic variables or IQ. The findings supported the clinical impression that a large percentage of adolescents referred for gender dysphoria have a substantial co-occurring history of psychosocial and psychological vulnerability, thus supporting a ``proof of principle'' for the importance of a comprehensive psychologic/psychiatric assessment that goes beyond an evaluation of gender dysphoria per se.},

It is capable of interacting with cyclic AMP, p53, murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) playing a role in cell proliferation control. MEG3 expression is under epigenetic control, and aberrant CpG methylation has been observed in several types of cancer. Moreover, gene copy number loss has been reported as additional mechanism associated with tumorigenesis. MEG3 deletion seems to upregulate the paternally expressed genes and on the other hand downregulate the expression of downstream maternally expressed genes and tumor suppressor miRNAs, although there are conflicting data on the topic. MEG3 could represent a tumor suppressor gene located in chromosome 14q32 and its association with tumorigenesis is growing every day.},

This bias can dominate the signal of interest for analyses that focus on measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such as copy number estimation (DNA-seq). The bias is not consistent between samples; and there is no consensus as to the best methods to remove it in a single sample. We analyze regularities in the GC bias patterns, and find a compact description for this unimodal curve family. It is the GC content of the full DNA fragment, not only the sequenced read, that most influences fragment count. This GC effect is unimodal: both GC-rich fragments and AT-rich fragments are underrepresented in the sequencing results. This empirical evidence strengthens the hypothesis that PCR is the most important cause of the GC bias. We propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level, allowing strand-specific GC-effect correction regardless of the downstream smoothing or binning. These GC modeling considerations can inform other high-throughput sequencing analyses such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq.},

A full understanding of transgender identity requires studying cisgender identity too, and recognition that gender identity is continuous, develops across time and is not synonymous with gender expression or variations in gender-typed characteristics. Considerable evidence is needed before we can be confident that we are providing optimal treatment for children who are gender variant.},

We found abnormal profiles only for H3K79me2 on MLL-AF9 fusion target loci in LSCs. Inactivation of Dot1l led to downregulation of direct MLL-AF9 targets and an MLL translocation-associated gene expression signature, whereas global gene expression remained largely unaffected. Suppression of MLL translocation-associated gene expression corresponded with dependence of MLL-AF9 leukemia on Dot1l in~vivo. These data point to DOT1L as~a potential therapeutic target in MLL-rearranged leukemia.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Although many next-generation sequencing (NGS) read preprocessing tools already existed, we could not find any tool or combination of tools that met our requirements in terms of flexibility, correct handling of paired-end data and high performance. We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. RESULTS: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Trimmomatic is licensed under GPL V3. It is cross-platform (Java 1.5+ required) and available at http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic CONTACT: usadel@bio1.rwth-aachen.de SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The risk of suicide is high in the transgender population. Imitative suicide occurs when excess suicidal behavior is observed following news media coverage of suicide. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how often UK newspapers adhere to suicide reporting guidelines designed to minimize imitative suicide when they report the suicides of transgender individuals. Methods: A newspaper archive was searched for articles about the suicides of transgender people published between 2007 and 2017. Two reviewers applied a checklist of responsible reporting practices to assess adherence to guidelines. Results: There were 79 articles meeting inclusion criteria. The mean number of guideline breaches was 3.9 (of a maximum 10), with the most commonly breached guidelines an inappropriate headline (70.9\%) and failure to provide sources of support (60.8\%). Every article breached at least one guideline. There was not a significant difference between the different newspapers in mean number of guideline breaches (p = 0.24). Conclusion: There is generally poor adherence to responsible reporting guidelines in UK newspapers when reporting the suicides of transgender people.},

  abstract = {This paper is adapted from a presentation first given at the 2017 Association of Child Psychotherapists (ACP) Conference. We hope to give a feel of our work as psychoanalytic child psychotherapists working in a Tier 4 national assessment service for gender variant children and connect with our colleagues working therapeutically with these families in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and other settings. Gender variance does not have a single cause, or straightforward developmental pathway; rather it is a complex interplay of multiple factors, akin to sexuality in the diverse manifestations and `tributaries' taken. This paper is given as a plea for complexity, to counter the current intense focus on gender identity and the consequent reductionism this can lead to. To this end, three case studies from the clinic, taken from Under Five, Latency and Adolescent phases of development, are explored. The complexity of the cases is then discussed, followed by parallel issues of development, divergence and difference. These three `average' cases from the Gender Identity Development Services (GIDS) serve to demonstrate the need for child psychotherapy as part of multi-disciplinary thinking about gender variance and how attention must be maintained to each unique story and process of identity development; as well as our clinical task to establish and encourage depressive functioning and secondary processes where possible.},

  abstract = {Background Quality improvement (QI) is a priority for general practice, and GPs are expected to participate in and provide evidence of QI activity. There is growing interest in harnessing the potential of electronic health records (EHR) to improve patient care by supporting practices to find cases that could benefit from a medicines review. Aim To develop scalable and reproducible prescribing safety reports using patient-level EHR data. Design and setting UK general practices that contribute de-identified patient data to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Method A scoping phase used stakeholder consultations to identify primary care QI needs and potential indicators. QI reports containing real data were sent to 12 pilot practices that used Vision GP software and had expressed interest. The scale-up phase involved automating production and distribution of reports to all contributing practices that used both Vision and EMIS software systems. Benchmarking reports with patient-level case review lists for two prescribing safety indicators were sent to 457 practices in December 2017 following the initial scale-up (Figure 2). Results Two indicators were selected from the Royal College of General Practitioners Patient Safety Toolkit following stakeholder consultations for the pilot phase involving 12 GP practices. Pilot phase interviews showed that reports were used to review individual patient care, implement wider QI actions in the practice, and for appraisal and revalidation. Conclusion Electronic health record data can be used to provide standardised, reproducible reports that can be delivered at scale with minimal resource requirements. These can be used in a national QI initiative that impacts directly on patient care.},

  abstract = {The emergence of cooperation is a major conundrum of evolutionary biology. To unravel this evolutionary riddle, several models have been developed within the theoretical framework of spatial game theory, focussing on the interactions between two general classes of player, ``cooperators'' and ``defectors''. Generally, explicit movement in the spatial domain is not considered in these models, with strategies moving via imitation or through colonisation of neighbouring sites. We present here a spatially explicit stochastic individual-based model in which pure cooperators and defectors undergo random motion via diffusion and also chemotaxis guided by the gradient of a semiochemical. Individual movement rules are derived from an underlying system of reaction-diffusion-taxis partial differential equations which describes the dynamics of the local number of individuals and the concentration of the semiochemical. Local interactions are governed by the payoff matrix of the classical prisoner's dilemma, and accumulated payoffs are translated into offspring. We investigate the cases of both synchronous and non-synchronous generations. Focussing on an ecological scenario where defectors are parasitic on cooperators, we find that random motion and semiochemical sensing bring about self-generated patterns in which resident cooperators and parasitic defectors can coexist in proportions that fluctuate about non-zero values. Remarkably, coexistence emerges as a genuine consequence of the natural tendency of cooperators to aggregate into clusters, without the need for them to find physical shelter or outrun the parasitic defectors. This provides further evidence that spatial clustering enhances the benefits of mutual cooperation and plays a crucial role in preserving cooperative behaviours.},

These essays deepen her treatment of issues introduced by earlier work on the relationship between power and the body, the meaning \& purpose of the incest taboo, and the problems of kinship. "Undoing Gender constitutes Judith Butler's recent reflections on gender and sexuality, focusing on new kinship, psychoanalysis and the incest taboo, transgender, intersex, diagnostic categories, social violence, and the tasks of social transformation. In terms that draw from feminist and queer theory, Butler considers the norms that govern--and fail to govern--gender and sexuality as they relate to the constraints on recognizable personhood. The book constitutes a reconsideration of her earlier view on gender performativity from Gender Trouble. In this work, the critique of gender norms is clearly situated within the framework of human persistence and survival. And to "do" one's gender in certain ways sometimes implies "undoing" dominant notions of personhood. She writes about the "New Gender Politics" that has emerged in recent years, a combination of movements concerned with transgender, transsexuality, intersex, and their complex relations to feminist and queer theory."--Publisher's description.},

RESULTS: In this note we present BayesPeak, an R package for genome-wide peak-calling that provides a flexible implementation of the BayesPeak algorithm and is compatible with downstream BioConductor packages. The BayesPeak package introduces a new method for summarizing posterior probability output, along with methods for handling overfitting and support for parallel processing. We briefly compare the package with other common peak-callers. AVAILABILITY: Available as part of BioConductor version 2.6. URL: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BayesPeak.html.},

  abstract = {Notch signaling plays crucial roles in mediating cell fate choices in all metazoans largely by specifying the transcriptional output of one cell in response to a neighboring cell. The DNA-binding protein RBPJ is the principle effector of this pathway in mammals and, together with the transcription factor moiety of Notch (NICD), regulates the expression of target genes. The prevalent view presumes that RBPJ statically occupies consensus binding sites while exchanging repressors for activators in response to NICD. We present the first specific RBPJ chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing study  in mammalian cells. To dissect the mode of transcriptional regulation by RBPJ and identify its direct targets, whole-genome binding profiles were generated for RBPJ; its coactivator, p300; NICD; and the histone H3 modifications H3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), H3 Lys 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1), and histone H3 Lys  27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in myogenic cells under active or inhibitory Notch signaling conditions. Our results demonstrate dynamic binding of RBPJ in response to Notch activation at essentially all sites co-occupied by NICD. Additionally, we identify a distinct set of sites where RBPJ recruits neither NICD nor p300 and binds DNA statically, irrespective of Notch activity. These findings significantly modify our views on how RBPJ and Notch signaling mediate their activities and consequently impact on cell fate decisions.},

  abstract = {The role of transforming growth factor {$\beta$}1 (TGF-{$\beta$}1)-induced extracellular matrix proteins in the modulation of cellular response to the cytotoxic effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or Fas ligand was investigated. Murine L929 fibroblasts were prestimulated with or without TGF-{$\beta$}1 for 1\textendash 24 h and the resulting extracellular protein matrices were prepared. Unstimulated control L929 cells were then cultured on these matrices. Compared to control matrix-stimulated L929 cells, the TGF-{$\beta$}1 matrix-stimulated cells resisted TNF killing in the presence of actinomycin D (ActD), but became more susceptible to killing by anti-Fas antibodies/ActD. The induced TNF resistance is independent of the NF-{$\kappa$}B antiapoptotic effect. For example, exposure of TGF-{$\beta$}1 matrix-stimulated L929 cells to TNF failed to result in I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$} degradation and NF-{$\kappa$}B nuclear translocation or activation. Also, control matrix stimulated the activation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in L929 cells, whereas TGF-{$\beta$}1 matrix suppressed the activation. Nonetheless, in response to TNF, JNK activation was restored in the TGF-{$\beta$}1 matrix-stimulated cells. By metabolic labeling, ammonium sulfate precipitation and N-terminal amino acid microsequencing, TGF-{$\beta$}1 was shown to induce a novel matrix protein of 46 kDa (p46) from L929 cells. Adsorption of p46 by peptide antibodies against its N-terminus removed the TGF-{$\beta$}1 matrix protein-mediated protection against TNF/ActD cytotoxicity and its enhancement of anti-Fas/ActD killing, indicating that p46 is responsible for these effects. Immunostaining of L929 cells revealed that the antibodies were bound to a membrane protein of 100 kDa (p100). Thus, the matrix p46 is likely derived from the released membrane p100.},

  abstract = {RNA-seq analysis provides a powerful tool for revealing relationships between gene expression level and biological function of proteins. In order to identify differentially expressed genes among various RNA-seq datasets obtained from different experimental designs, an appropriate normalization method for calibrating multiple experimental datasets is the first challenging problem. We propose a novel method to facilitate biologists in selecting a set of suitable housekeeping genes for inter-sample normalization. The approach is achieved by adopting user defined experimentally related keywords, GO annotations, GO term distance matrices, orthologous housekeeping gene candidates, and stability ranking of housekeeping genes. By identifying the most distanced GO terms from query keywords and selecting housekeeping gene candidates with low coefficients of variation among different spatio-temporal datasets, the proposed method can automatically enumerate a set of functionally irrelevant housekeeping genes for pratical normalization. Novel and benchmark testing RNA-seq datasets were applied to demostrate that different selections of housekeeping gene lead to strong impact on differential gene expression analysis, and compared results have shown that our proposed method outperformed other traditional approaches in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. The proposed mechanism of selecting appropriate houskeeping genes for inter-dataset normalization is robust and accurate for differential expression analyses.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Despite continual efforts to develop a prognostic model of gastric cancer by using clinical and pathologic parameters, a clinical test that can discriminate patients with good outcomes from those with poor outcomes after gastric cancer surgery has not been established. We aim to develop practical biomarker-based risk score that can predict relapse of gastric cancer after surgical treatment. Experimental Design: Microarray technologies were used to generate and analyze gene expression profiling data from 65 gastric cancer patients to identify biomarker genes associated with relapse. The association of expression patterns of identified genes with relapse and overall survival was validated in independent gastric cancer patients. Results: We uncovered two subgroups of gastric cancer that were strongly associated with the prognosis. For the easy translation of our findings into practice, we developed a scoring system based on the expression of six genes that predicted the likelihood of relapse after curative resection. In multivariate analysis, the risk score was an independent predictor of relapse in a cohort of 96 patients. We were able to validate the robustness of the six-gene signature in an additional independent cohort. Conclusions: The risk score derived from the six-gene set successfully prognosticated the relapse of gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy.

Despite having a conserved basic morphology, cilia vary extensively in their shapes and sizes, ultrastructural details, numbers per cell, motility patterns and sensory capabilities. Emerging evidence indicates that this diversity, which is intimately linked to the different functions that cilia perform, is in large part programmed at the transcriptional level. Here, we review our understanding of the transcriptional control of ciliary biogenesis, highlighting the activities of FOXJ1 and the RFX family of transcriptional regulators. In addition, we examine how a number of signaling pathways, and lineage and cell fate determinants can induce and modulate ciliogenic programs to bring about the differentiation of distinct cilia types.},

Mutations in cancer are rare (0.1\textendash 100/Mb) and often occur only in a subset of the sequenced cells, either due to contamination by normal cells or due to tumor heterogeneity. Consequently, mutation calling methods need to be both specific, avoiding false positives, and sensitive to detect clonal and sub-clonal mutations. The decreased sensitivity of existing methods for low allelic fraction mutations highlights the pressing need for improved and systematically evaluated mutation detection methods. Here we present MuTect, a method based on a Bayesian classifier designed to detect somatic mutations with very low allele-fractions, requiring only a few supporting reads, followed by a set of carefully tuned filters that ensure high specificity. We also describe novel benchmarking approaches, which use real sequencing data to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity as a function of sequencing depth, base quality and allelic fraction. Compared with other methods, MuTect has higher sensitivity with similar specificity, especially for mutations with allelic fractions as low as 0.1 and below, making MuTect particularly useful for studying cancer subclones and their evolution in standard exome and genome sequencing data.},

Of 2351 transgender people with newly diagnosed HIV infection during 2009-2014, 84.0\% were transgender women (male-to-female), 15.4\% were transgender men (female-to-male), and 0.7\% were additional gender identity (e.g., gender queer, bi-gender). Over half of both transgender women (50.8\%; 1002/1974) and men (58.4\%; 211/361) with newly diagnosed HIV infection were non-Hispanic black/African American. Improvements in data collection methods and quality are needed to gain a better understanding of HIV burden among transgender people.},

  abstract = {Curcumin is a potential agent for both the prevention and treatment of cancers. Curcumin treatment alone, or in combination with piperine, limits breast stem cell self-renewal, while remaining non-toxic to normal differentiated cells. We paired fluorescence-activated cell sorting with RNA sequencing to characterize the genome-wide changes induced specifically in normal breast stem cells following treatment with these compounds. We generated genome-wide maps of the transcriptional changes that occur in epithelial-like (ALDH+) and mesenchymal-like (ALDH-/CD44+/CD24-) normal breast stem/progenitor cells following treatment with curcumin and piperine. We show that curcumin targets both stem cell populations by down-regulating expression of breast stem cell genes including ALDH1A3, CD49f, PROM1, and TP63. We also identified novel genes and pathways targeted by curcumin, including downregulation of SCD. Transient siRNA knockdown of SCD in MCF10A cells significantly inhibited mammosphere formation and the mean proportion of CD44+/CD24- cells, suggesting that SCD is a regulator of breast stemness and a target of curcumin in breast stem cells. These findings extend previous reports of curcumin targeting stem cells, here in two phenotypically distinct stem/progenitor populations isolated from normal human breast tissue. We identified novel mechanisms by which curcumin and piperine target breast stem cell self-renewal, such as by targeting lipid metabolism, providing a mechanistic link between curcumin treatment and stem cell self-renewal. These results elucidate the mechanisms by which curcumin may act as a cancer-preventive compound and provide novel targets for cancer prevention and treatment.},

We also provide data summarization types for quantifying novel transcribed sequence including base-resolution coverage and potentially unannotated splice junctions. We present workflows illustrating how to use recount to perform differential expression analysis including meta-analysis, annotation-free base-level analysis, and replication of smaller studies using data from larger studies. recount provides a valuable and user-friendly resource of processed RNA-seq datasets to draw additional biological insights from existing public data.

  abstract = {Background Historically, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) health research has focused heavily on the risks for poor health outcomes, obscuring the ways in which LGBTQ populations maintain and improve their health across the life course. In this paper we argue that informing culturally competent health policy and systems requires shifting the LGBTQ health research evidence base away from deficit-focused approaches toward strengths-based approaches to understanding and measuring LGBTQ health. Methods We recently conducted a scoping review with the aim of exploring strengths-based approaches to LGBTQ health research. Our team found that the concept of resilience emerged as a key conceptual framework. This paper discusses a subset of our scoping review findings on the utility of resilience as a conceptual framework in understanding and measuring LGBTQ health. Results The findings of our scoping review suggest that the ways in which resilience is defined and measured in relation to LGBTQ populations remains contested. Given that LGBTQ populations have unique lived experiences of adversity and discrimination, and may also have unique factors that contribute to their resilience, the utility of heteronormative and cis-normative models of resilience is questionable. Our findings suggest that there is a need to consider further exploration and development of LGBTQ-specific models and measures of resilience that take into account structural, social, and individual determinants of health and incorporate an intersectional lens. Conclusions While we fully acknowledge that the resilience of LGBTQ populations is central to advancing LGBTQ health, there remains much work to be done before the concept of resilience can be truly useful in measuring LGBTQ health.},

Our Regulatory Build has been revamped to identify regulatory regions of interest and to efficiently highlight their activity across disparate epigenetic data sets. A number of new interfaces allow users to perform large-scale comparisons of their data against our annotations. The REST server (http://rest.ensembl.org), which allows programs written in any language to query our databases, has moved to a full service alongside our upgraded website tools. Our online Variant Effect Predictor tool has been updated to process more variants and calculate summary statistics. Lastly, the WiggleTools package enables users to summarize large collections of data sets and view them as single tracks in Ensembl. The Ensembl code base itself is more accessible: it is now hosted on our GitHub organization page (https://github.com/Ensembl) under an Apache 2.0 open source license.},

  abstract = {Automatically reasoning with conflicting generic clinical guidelines is a burning issue in patient-centric medical reasoning where patient-specific conditions and goals need to be taken into account. It is even more challenging in the presence of preferences such as patient's wishes and clinician's priorities over goals. We advance a structured argumentation formalism for reasoning with conflicting clinical guidelines, patient-specific information and preferences. Our formalism integrates assumption-based reasoning and goal-driven selection among reasoning outcomes. Specifically, we assume applicability of guideline recommendations concerning the generic goal of patient well-being, resolve conflicts among recommendations using patient's conditions and preferences, and then consider prioritised patient-centered goals to yield non-conflicting, goal-maximising and preference-respecting recommendations. We rely on the state-of-the-art Transition-based Medical Recommendation model for representing guideline recommendations and augment it with context given by the patient's conditions, goals, as well as preferences over recommendations and goals. We establish desirable properties of our approach in terms of sensitivity to recommendation conflicts and patient context.},

  abstract = {Prostaglandins (PGs) such as PGE2 enhance proliferation in many cells, apparently through several distinct mechanisms, including transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) as well as EGFR-independent pathways. In this study we found that in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes PGE2 did not induce phosphorylation of the EGFR, and the EGFR tyrosine kinase blockers gefitinib and AG1478 did not affect PGE2-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2. In contrast, PGE2 elicited EGFR phosphorylation and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitive ERK phosphorylation in MH1C1 hepatoma cells. These findings suggest that PGE2 elicits EGFR transactivation in MH1C1 cells but not in hepatocytes. Treatment of the hepatocytes with PGE2 at 3 h after plating amplified the stimulatory effect on DNA synthesis of EGF administered at 24 h and advanced and augmented the cyclin D1 expression in response to EGF in hepatocytes. The pretreatment of the hepatocytes with PGE2 resulted in an increase in the magnitude of EGF-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and kinase activity, including an extended duration of the responses, particularly of ERK, to EGF in PGE2-treated cells. Pertussis toxin abolished the ability of PGE2 to enhance the Akt and ERK responses to EGF. The results suggest that in hepatocytes, unlike MH1C1 hepatoma cells, PGE2 does not transactivate the EGFR, but instead acts in synergism with EGF by modulating mitogenic mechanisms downstream of the EGFR. These effects seem to be at least in part G(i) protein-mediated and include upregulation of signaling in the PI3K/Akt and the Ras/ERK pathways.},

METHOD: A Medline search was performed with the subject term "transsexualism" or "gender dysphoria" and "outcome" or "follow-up" in the title. Studies published from 2005 onwards reporting psychosocial outcomes were selected for review. RESULTS: Most available evidence indicating positive outcomes for gender reassignment is of poor quality. The few studies with robust methodology suggest that some patients have poor outcomes and may be at risk of suicide. CONCLUSION: The author raises questions about the implications for ethical treatment of transgender individuals.},

  abstract = {Introduction The prevalence of gender dysphoria in children is not known; however, there are some data on the sex ratio of children referred to specialized gender identity clinics. Aim We sought to examine the sex ratio of children, and some associated factors (age at referral and year of referral), referred to the Gender Identity Development Service in the United Kingdom, the largest such clinic in the world. Methods The sex ratio of children (N~= 1,215) referred to the Gender Identity Development Service between 2000\textendash 2017 was examined, along with year of referral, age-related patterns, and age at referral. Main Outcome Measure Sex ratio of birth-assigned boys vs birth-assigned girls. Results The sex ratio significantly favored birth-assigned boys over birth-assigned girls (1.27:1), but there were also age and year of referral effects. The sex ratio favored birth-assigned boys at younger ages (3\textendash 9 years), but favored birth-assigned girls at older ages (10\textendash 12 years). The percentage of referred birth-assigned boys significantly decreased when 2 cohorts were compared (2000\textendash 2006 vs 2007\textendash 2017). On average, birth-assigned boys were referred at a younger age than birth-assigned girls. Clinical Implications The evidence for a change in the sex ratio of children referred for gender dysphoria, particularly in recent years, matches a similar change in the sex ratio of adolescents referred for gender dysphoria. The reasons for this remain understudied. Strength \& Limitations The United Kingdom data showed both similarities and differences when compared to data from 2 other gender identity clinics for children (Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Such data need to be studied in more gender identity clinics for children, perhaps with the establishment of an international registry. Conclusion Further study of the correlates of the sex ratio for children referred for gender dysphoria will be useful in clinical care and management. de Graaf NM, Carmichael P, Steensma TD, et~al.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Rho GTPases play a central role in actin-based cytoskeleton reorganization and regulate multiple signaling pathways that control gene transcription, cell survival, and proliferation. We investigated the effect of Rho GTPases on cell cycle regulation and progenitor genes expression on mouse ciliary epithelium (CE), a potential source of progenitor/stem cells in the adult retina. METHODS: Rho GTPases were activated by intraocular injection of lysophosphatidic acid and inactivated by Clostridium difficile Toxin A (general Rho GTPase inhibitor), NSC23766 (Rac1 activation inhibitor), or Y27632 (Rho-associated protein kinase [ROCK] inhibitor). Thereafter, we assayed for RhoA, RhoB, and Rac1 protein localization in CE cells. Proliferation was examined by the expression levels of cell cycle regulators p27(kip), p16(INK4a), and Ki67  and the effects on progenitors by determining the changes in Pax6 and Chx10 progenitor markers expression. RESULTS: All GTPases investigated were expressed in mouse CE cells. Activation increased the coexpression of Pax6 and Chx10, but had no significant effect on the proliferation of CE cells. In contrast, Rho GTPases inactivation increased cell proliferation and potentiated the proliferative effect of growth factors. Specific inactivation of Rac1 or ROCK increased the levels of Ki67 and decreased the expression of the cell cycle inhibitors p27(kip) and p16(INK4a). CONCLUSIONS: This study reports that Rho GTPase modulation (activation and inactivation) controls the expression of retinal progenitor genes and proliferation, respectively, in the adult ciliary epithelial progenitor/stem cells of rodent eyes. The modulation of these two different mechanisms (proliferation and reprogramming) may provide a potential new approach in retinal repair.},

We describe an approach for developing, validating, and sharing reproducible phenotypes from national structured EHR in the United Kingdom with applications for translational research.We implemented a rule-based phenotyping framework, with up to 6 approaches of validation. We applied our framework to a sample of 15 million individuals in a national EHR data source (population-based primary care, all ages) linked to hospitalization and death records in England. Data comprised continuous measurements (for example, blood pressure; medication information; coded diagnoses, symptoms, procedures, and referrals), recorded using 5 controlled clinical terminologies: (1) read (primary care, subset of SNOMED-CT [Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms]), (2) International Classification of Diseases\textendash Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision (secondary care diagnoses and cause of mortality), (3) Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures, Fourth Revision (hospital surgical procedures), and (4) DM+D prescription codes.Using the CALIBER phenotyping framework, we created algorithms for 51 diseases, syndromes, biomarkers, and lifestyle risk factors and provide up to 6 validation approaches. The EHR phenotypes are curated in the open-access CALIBER Portal (https://www.caliberresearch.org/portal) and have been used by 40 national and international research groups in 60 peer-reviewed publications.We describe a UK EHR phenomics approach within the CALIBER EHR data platform with initial evidence of validity and use, as an important step toward international use of UK EHR data for health research.},

We present a unified analytic framework to discover and genotype variation among multiple samples simultaneously that achieves sensitive and specific results across five sequencing technologies and three distinct, canonical experimental designs. Our process includes (i) initial read mapping; (ii) local realignment around indels; (iii) base quality score recalibration; (iv) SNP discovery and genotyping to find all potential variants; and (v) machine learning to separate true segregating variation from machine artifacts common to next-generation sequencing technologies. We here discuss the application of these tools, instantiated in the Genome Analysis Toolkit, to deep whole-genome, whole-exome capture and multi-sample low-pass ({$\sim$}4\texttimes ) 1000 Genomes Project datasets.},

Such normalization assumes constant HKG gene expression under all circumstances. Although sporadic evidence suggests that HKG expression may not always fulfill this requirement and, therefore, such normalization may lead readily to erroneous results, this fact is generally not sufficiently appreciated by investigators. Here, we have systematically analyzed the expression of three common HKGs, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ribosomal subunit 18S and beta-actin, in two different stress paradigms, in various brain areas, in male and in female rats. HKG expressions differed considerably with respect to brain area, type of stressor and gender, in an HKG-specific manner. Therefore, we conclude that before final experimentation, pilot expression studies are necessary to select an HKG which expression is unaffected by the experimental factor(s), allowing reliable interpretation of expression data of genes of interest.},

  abstract = {Context The treatment for transsexualism is sex reassignment, including hormonal treatment and surgery aimed at making the person's body as congruent with the opposite sex as possible. There is a dearth of long term, follow-up studies after sex reassignment. Objective To estimate mortality, morbidity, and criminal rate after surgical sex reassignment of transsexual persons. Design A population-based matched cohort study. Setting Sweden, 1973-2003. Participants All 324 sex-reassigned persons (191 male-to-females, 133 female-to-males) in Sweden, 1973\textendash 2003. Random population controls (10{$:$}1) were matched by birth year and birth sex or reassigned (final) sex, respectively. Main Outcome Measures Hazard ratios (HR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality and psychiatric morbidity were obtained with Cox regression models, which were adjusted for immigrant status and psychiatric morbidity prior to sex reassignment (adjusted HR [aHR]). Results The overall mortality for sex-reassigned persons was higher during follow-up (aHR 2.8; 95\% CI 1.8\textendash 4.3) than for controls of the same birth sex, particularly death from suicide (aHR 19.1; 95\% CI 5.8\textendash 62.9). Sex-reassigned persons also had an increased risk for suicide attempts (aHR 4.9; 95\% CI 2.9\textendash 8.5) and psychiatric inpatient care (aHR 2.8; 95\% CI 2.0\textendash 3.9). Comparisons with controls matched on reassigned sex yielded similar results. Female-to-males, but not male-to-females, had a higher risk for criminal convictions than their respective birth sex controls. Conclusions Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group.},

A total of 767 people (289 natal females and 478 natal males) applied for legal and surgical sex reassignment. Out of these, 89~\% (252 female-to-males [FM] and 429 male-to-females [MF]) received a new legal gender and underwent sex reassignment surgery (SRS). A total of 25 individuals (7 natal females and 18 natal males), equaling 3.3~\%, were denied a new legal gender and SRS. The remaining withdrew their application, were on a waiting list for surgery, or were granted partial treatment. The incidence of applications was calculated and stratified over four periods between 1972 and 2010. The incidence increased significantly from 0.16 to 0.42/100,000/year (FM) and from 0.23 to 0.73/100,000/year (MF). The most pronounced increase occurred after 2000. The proportion of FM individuals 30~years or older at the time of application remained stable around 30~\%. In contrast, the proportion of MF individuals 30~years or older increased from 37~\% in the first decade to 60~\% in the latter three decades. The point prevalence at December 2010 for individuals who applied for a new legal gender was for FM 1:13,120 and for MF 1:7,750. The FM:MF sex ratio fluctuated but was 1:1.66 for the whole study period. There were 15 (5 MF and 10 MF) regret applications corresponding to a 2.2~\% regret rate for both sexes. There was a significant decline of regrets over the time period.},

  abstract = {Studies investigating the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among trans individuals have identified elevated rates of psychopathology. Research has also provided conflicting psychiatric outcomes following gender-confirming medical interventions. This review identifies 38 cross-sectional and longitudinal studies describing prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders and psychiatric outcomes, pre- and post-gender-confirming medical interventions, for people with gender dysphoria. It indicates that, although the levels of psychopathology and psychiatric disorders in trans people attending services at the time of assessment are higher than in the cis population, they do improve following gender-confirming medical intervention, in many cases reaching normative values. The main Axis I psychiatric disorders were found to be depression and anxiety disorder. Other major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, were rare and were no more prevalent than in the general population. There was conflicting evidence regarding gender differences: some studies found higher psychopathology in trans women, while others found no differences between gender groups. Although many studies were methodologically weak, and included people at different stages of transition within the same cohort of patients, overall this review indicates that trans people attending transgender health-care services appear to have a higher risk of psychiatric morbidity (that improves following treatment), and thus confirms the vulnerability of this population.},

  abstract = {Gender identity refers to an innate and deeply felt psychological identification as a female, male, or some other non-binary gender. Gender identity may be congruent or incongruent with the sex assigned at birth. Gender dysphoria refers to the discomfort or distress that gender incongruence may cause. If the distress is clinically significant, the individual may need gender-affirming treatment. The literature is sparse with respect to the etiology, prevalence, and long-term outcomes. The overall aim of this thesis is to further our understanding of gender dysphoria regarding neurobiological characteristics, epidemiology, and health following gender-affirming treatment.         Study I explored the hypothesis that cerebral activation in hormone-na\"ive transgender women (assigned males at birth) on exposure to odorous steroids would be in line with their gender identity, and thus similar to cisgender women but different to cisgender men. Gender dysphoric transgender women demonstrated a cerebral activation pattern that corresponded predominately to that of cisgender females, but also some cisgender male characteristics.         Study II described the prevalence and changes in incidence of applications for change of legal gender and applications to reverse the procedure during 1960- 2010. The incidence of gender dysphoria increased three times for individuals assigned male at birth, and two and half time times for individuals assigned female at birth. The increase accelerated after 2001. The rate of reversal applications was 2.2\% with a significant decline over the study period.         Study III explored long-term mortality and psychiatric morbidity after sex reassignment in a nation-wide cohort study (1973-2003). The overall mortality rate was higher in individuals who had undergone legal and medical transition compared with the general population for the whole period, but not for the period 1989-2003. Probands had more psychiatric inpatient care and suicide attempts compared with controls for the whole period as well as the period 1989-2003 (with the exception of suicide attempts). This study cannot determine the effectiveness of gender-affirming medical intervention, but the results highlight the need for better health care following gender transition.         Study IV examined outcomes following legal and surgical gender transition, mean (SD) follow-up time 7.2 (7.3) years, by means of individual interviews with 16 men (assigned female at birth) and 49 women (assigned male at birth). The vast majority of the participants felt gender congruent and global clinically improved, but the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity and suicide attempts was high. Childhood adversities and adult stressful life events were common. Being born abroad, childhood adversities, and not being accepted by others in assigned gender predicted current psychiatric morbidity.},

  abstract = {Problem Definition Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) populations are disproportionately affected by limited health care access and poor health outcomes and commonly report discrimination and mistreatment in health care settings. Despite these disparities, comprehensive approaches to improve the quality of health care of TGNC patient populations are currently lacking. Initial Approach The Vanderbilt Program for LGBTQ Health has developed a multifaceted, community-engaged approach to improve the quality of health care of TGNC patients, which includes the creation of a transgender patient advocacy program, a community advisory board, and a transgender health clinic. To support the continuous quality improvement of transgender health care, the program is currently piloting a novel multilevel monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) system to collect information at the individual patient visit and health systems levels. Next Steps The next steps for Vanderbilt's community-engaged M\&E system are to identify the clinics and health services most used by TGNC patients and assess the level of patient satisfaction in each area. This process will support the identification of high- and low-performing clinics and health services and allow for targeted delivery of trainings to improve the quality of culturally competent health care TGNC patients receive systemwide. Conclusion In collaboration with TGNC patient populations and community stakeholders, Vanderbilt has created a model to improve the quality of both transition- and non-transition-related health care at the systems level that can be adopted by other health care systems nationally.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. Results: To align our large (exceeding 80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously un-described RNA-seq alignment algorithm which utilizes sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by more than a factor of 50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 Million 2x76bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons, we experimentally validated 1,960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. Implementation and Availability: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

Here we report a novel strategy used by a single protein to regulate chronologically cell survival and death. The interferon-induced protein kinase PKR acts as a molecular clock by using catalysis-dependent and -independent activities to temporally induce cell survival prior to cell death. We show that the proapoptotic protein PKR surprisingly activates a survival pathway, which is mediated by NF-{$\kappa$}B to delay apoptosis. Cell death is then induced by PKR through the phosphorylation of eIF-2{$\alpha$}. This unique temporal control might serve as a paradigm for other kinases whose catalytic activity is not required for all of their functions.},

  abstract = {Objective To investigate whether the incentive scheme for UK general practitioners led them to neglect activities not included in the scheme. Design Longitudinal analysis of achievement rates for 42 activities (23 included in incentive scheme, 19 not included) selected from 428 identified indicators of quality of care. Setting 148 general practices in England (653 500 patients). Main outcome measures Achievement rates projected from trends in the pre-incentive period (2000-1 to 2002-3) and actual rates in the first three years of the scheme (2004-5 to 2006-7). Results Achievement rates improved for most indicators in the pre-incentive period. There were significant increases in the rate of improvement in the first year of the incentive scheme (2004-5) for 22 of the 23 incentivised indicators. Achievement for these indicators reached a plateau after 2004-5, but quality of care in 2006-7 remained higher than that predicted by pre-incentive trends for 14 incentivised indicators. There was no overall effect on the rate of improvement for non-incentivised indicators in the first year of the scheme, but by 2006-7 achievement rates were significantly below those predicted by pre-incentive trends. Conclusions There were substantial improvements in quality for all indicators between 2001 and 2007. Improvements associated with financial incentives seem to have been achieved at the expense of small detrimental effects on aspects of care that were not incentivised.},

This Personal View focuses on the Working Group's proposals to include the diagnosis gender incongruence of childhood in ICD-11 and to move gender incongruence of childhood out of the mental and behavioural disorders chapter of ICD-11. We outline the history of ICD and DSM child gender diagnoses, expert consensus, knowledge gaps, and controversies related to the diagnosis and treatment of extremely gender-variant children. We argue that retaining the gender incongruence of childhood category is justified as a basis to structure clinical care and to ensure access to appropriate services for this vulnerable population, which provides opportunities for education and informed consent, the development of standards and pathways of care to help guide clinicians and family members, and a basis for future research efforts.},

At follow-up, three (12\%) of the girls were judged to have persistent GID based on DSM-IV criteria. With regard to behavior problems at follow-up, 39.1\% of the girls had a clinical range score on either the Child Behavior Checklist or Adult Behavior Checklist as rated by their mothers, and 33.3\% had a clinical range score on either the Youth Self-Report or the Adult Self-Report. On either the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents or the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, the girls had, on average, 2.67 diagnoses (range: 0\textendash 10); 46\% met criteria for three or more diagnoses. From the childhood assessment, five variables were significantly associated with a composite Psychopathology Index (PI) at follow-up: a lower IQ, living in a non-two-parent or reconstituted family, a composite behavior problem index, and poor peer relations. At follow-up, degree of concurrent homoeroticism and a composite index of gender dysphoria were both associated with the composite PI. Girls with GID show a psychiatric vulnerability at the time of follow-up in late adolescence or adulthood, although there was considerable variation in their general well-being.},

Complicating our task is that many terms, such as ``protecting data'' or ``sensitive data,'' have no universally accepted meaning. Driven by variations in their historical and legal environment, DSOs exhibit differences in how they use terminology. This can lead to confusion in discussions among DSOs and indeed within the SDL research community as well. In this chapter we lay out widely accepted concepts and a terminology that provides a common framework intended to minimize confusion.

Interestingly, much of what we discuss was only hinted at two decades ago by Duncan and Pearson (1991). Their glimpse to the future is today's reality. Anticipating tomorrow requires a new and expanded forecast.},

  abstract = {Objective Social transitions are increasingly common for transgender children. A social transition involves a child presenting to other people as a member of the ``opposite'' gender in all contexts (e.g., wearing clothes and using pronouns of that gender). Little is known about the well-being of socially transitioned transgender children. This study examined self-reported depression, anxiety, and self-worth in socially transitioned transgender children compared with 2 control groups: age- and gender-matched controls and siblings of transgender children. Method As part of a longitudinal study (TransYouth Project), children (9\textendash 14 years old) and their parents completed measurements of depression and anxiety (n~=~63 transgender children, n~= 63 controls, n~= 38 siblings). Children (6\textendash 14 years old; n~= 116 transgender children, n~= 122 controls, n~= 72 siblings) also reported on their self-worth. Mental health and self-worth were compared across groups. Results Transgender children reported depression and self-worth that did not differ from their matched-control or sibling peers (p~= .311), and they reported marginally higher anxiety (p~= .076). Compared with national averages, transgender children showed typical rates of depression (p~= .290) and marginally higher rates of anxiety (p~= .096). Parents similarly reported that their transgender children experienced more anxiety than children in the control groups (p~= .002) and rated their transgender children as having equivalent levels of depression (p~= .728). Conclusion These findings are in striking contrast to previous work with gender-nonconforming children who had not socially transitioned, which found very high rates of depression and anxiety. These findings lessen concerns from previous work that parents of socially transitioned children could be systematically underreporting mental health problems.},

  abstract = {The complexity and diversity of proteoglycan structure means that they have a range of functions that regulate cell behavior. Through multiple interactions of their core proteins and glycosaminoglycans with extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors and chemokines, proteoglycans affect cell signaling, motility, adhesion, growth and apoptosis. Progressive changes in proteoglycans occur in the tumor microenvironment, but neither the source nor consequences of those changes are well understood. Proteoglycans studied in prostate cancer include versican\textemdash a hyalectan regulator of cell adhesion and migration\textemdash and the small leucine-rich proteoglycans decorin, biglycan and lumican, which have roles in cell signaling and tissue organization. Studies support an inhibitory role in prostate cancer for decorin and lumican. Conversely, the basement membrane proteoglycan perlecan might be a tumor promoter through upregulation of sonic hedgehog signaling. Loss of the growth-inhibitory cell-surface proteoglycans syndecan-1 and betaglycan in early prostate cancer might facilitate progression, but syndecan-1 effects are pleiotropic and its renewed expression in advanced tumors might adversely affect outcome. Importantly, cellular changes and enzymatic activity in the developing tumor can alter proteoglycan composition and structure to modify their function. Emerging studies suggest that cancers, including those of the prostate, use these changes to promote their own survival, growth, and spread.},

In addition, housekeeping genes are instrumental for calibration in many biotechnological applications and genomic studies. Advances in our ability to measure RNA expression have resulted in a gradual increase in the number of identified housekeeping genes. Here, we describe housekeeping gene detection in the era of massive parallel sequencing and RNA-seq. We emphasize the importance of expression at a constant level and provide a list of 3804 human genes that are expressed uniformly across a panel of tissues. Several exceptionally uniform genes are singled out for future experimental use, such as RT-PCR control genes. Finally, we discuss both ways in which current technology can meet some of past obstacles encountered, and several as yet unmet challenges.},

This study uses a large school-based sample of adolescents to describe the prevalence of TGNC identity, associations with health risk behaviors and protective factors, and differences across birth-assigned sex. Methods This study analyzes existing surveillance data provided by 9th and 11th grade students in Minnesota in 2016 (N~= 81,885). Students who were transgender, genderqueer, genderfluid, or unsure about their gender identity (TGNC) were compared with those who were not, using {$\chi$}2 and t-tests. Outcome measures included four domains of high-risk behaviors and experiences and four protective factors. Results The prevalence of TGNC identity was 2.7\% (n~= 2,168) and varied significantly across gender, race/ethnicity, and economic indicators. Involvement in all types of risk behaviors and experiences was significantly higher, and reports of four protective factors were significantly lower among TGNC than cisgender youth. For example, almost two-thirds (61.3\%) of TGNC youth reported suicidal ideation, which is over three times higher than cisgender youth (20.0\%, {$\chi$}2~=~1959.9, p {$<$} .001). Among TGNC youth, emotional distress and bullying experience were significantly more common among birth-assigned females than males. Conclusions This research presents the first large-scale, population-based evidence of substantial health disparities for TGNC adolescents in the United States, highlighting numerous multilevel points of intervention through established protective factors. Health care providers are advised to act as allies by creating a safe space for young people, bolstering protective factors, and supporting their healthy development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many animal models have been developed to characterize the complexity of colonic inflammation. In dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) experimental colitis in mice the choice of reference genes is critical for accurate quantification of target genes using quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR). No studies have addressed the performance of reference genes in mice DSS-experimental colitis. This study aimed to determine the stability of reference genes expression (RGE) in DSS-experimental murine colitis. METHODS: Colitis was induced in male C57BL/6 mice using DSS5\% for 5 days, control group received water. RNA was extracted from inflamed and non-inflamed colon. Using RT-qPCR, comparative analysis of 13 RGE was performed according to predefined criteria and relative colonic TNF-{$\alpha$} and IL-1{$\beta$} gene expression was determined by calculating the difference in the threshold cycle. RESULTS: Colitis significantly altered the stability of mucosal RGE. Commonly used glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), {$\beta$}-actin (Actb), or {$\beta$}2-microglobulin ({$\beta$}2m) showed the highest variability within the inflamed and control groups. Conversely, TATA-box-binding protein (Tbp) and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (Eef2) were not affected by inflammation and were the most stable genes. Normalization of colonic TNF-{$\alpha$} and IL-1{$\beta$} mRNA levels was dependent on the reference gene used. Depending on the genes used to normalize the data, statistical significance varied from significant when TBP / Eef2 were used to non-significant when Gapdh, Actb or {$\beta$}2m were used. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the appropriate choice of RGE to ensure adequate normalization of RT-qPCR data when using this model. Suboptimal RGE may explain controversial results from published studies. We recommend using Tbp and Eef2 instead of Gapdh, Actb or {$\beta$}2m as reference genes.},

  abstract = {Summary Intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions are used by many noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) to achieve their diverse functions. To identify these contacts, we developed a method based on RNA antisense purification to systematically map RNA-RNA interactions (RAP-RNA) and applied it to investigate two ncRNAs implicated in RNA processing: U1 small nuclear RNA, a component of the spliceosome, and Malat1, a large ncRNA that localizes to nuclear speckles. U1 and Malat1 interact with nascent transcripts through distinct targeting mechanisms. Using differential crosslinking, we confirmed that U1 directly hybridizes to 5{${'}$} splice sites and 5{${'}$} splice site motifs throughout introns and found that Malat1 interacts with pre-mRNAs indirectly through protein intermediates. Interactions with nascent pre-mRNAs cause U1 and Malat1 to localize proximally to chromatin at active genes, demonstrating that ncRNAs can use RNA-RNA interactions to target specific pre-mRNAs and genomic sites. RAP-RNA is sensitive to lower abundance RNAs as well, making it generally applicable for investigating ncRNAs.},

  abstract = {Mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed to produce thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). A few of these lncRNAs have been shown to recruit regulatory complexes through RNA\textendash protein interactions to influence the expression of nearby genes, and it has been suggested that many other lncRNAs can also act as local regulators. Such local functions could explain the observation that lncRNA expression is often correlated with the expression of nearby genes. However, these correlations have been challenging to dissect and could alternatively result from processes that are not mediated by the lncRNA transcripts themselves. For example, some gene promoters have been proposed to have dual functions as enhancers, and the process of transcription itself may contribute to gene regulation by recruiting activating factors or remodelling nucleosomes. Here we use genetic manipulation in mouse cell lines to dissect 12 genomic loci that produce lncRNAs and find that 5 of these loci influence the expression of a neighbouring gene in cis. Notably, none of these effects requires the specific lncRNA transcripts themselves and instead involves general processes associated with their production, including enhancer-like activity of gene promoters, the process of transcription, and the splicing of the transcript. Furthermore, such effects are not limited to lncRNA loci: we find that four out of six protein-coding loci also influence the expression of a neighbour. These results demonstrate that cross-talk among neighbouring genes is a prevalent phenomenon that can involve multiple mechanisms and cis-regulatory signals, including a role for RNA splice sites. These mechanisms may explain the function and evolution of some genomic loci that produce lncRNAs and broadly contribute to the regulation of both coding and non-coding genes.},

Using a typology of theory use in scholarly articles, we analyzed these articles for the types of theories being used, the degree to which theories were used in each article, and the analytical function they served. We found that 52\% of articles consistently applied theory, 23\% implied or partially applied theory, and 25\% presented as atheoretical. A wide range of theories were used and served multiple analytical functions such as concept development and explanation of findings. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of theory use in this body of literature, especially with respect to implications for future knowledge development in the field.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The normalization of DNA microarrays allows comparison among samples by adjusting for individual hybridization intensities. The approaches most commonly used are global normalization methods that are based on the expression of all genes on the slide and on the modulation of a small proportion of genes. Alternative approaches must be developed for microarrays where the proportion of modulated genes and their distribution are unknown and they may be biased towards up- or down-modulated trends. RESULTS: The aim of the work is to study the use of spike-in controls to normalize low-density microarrays. Our test-array was designed to analyze gene modulation in response to hypoxia (a condition of low oxygen tension) in a macrophage cell line. RNA was extracted from controls and cells exposed to hypoxia, mixed with spike RNA, labeled and hybridized to our test-array. We used eight bacterial RNAs as source of spikes. The test-array contained the oligonucleotides specific for 178 mouse genes and those specific for the eight spikes. We assessed the quality of the spike signals, the reproducibility of the results and, in general, the nature of the variability. The small values of the coefficients of variation revealed high reproducibility of our platform either in replicated spots or in technical replicates. We demonstrated that the spike-in system was suitable for normalizing our platform and determining the threshold for discriminating the hypoxia modulated genes. We assessed the application of the spike-in normalization method to microarrays in which the distribution of the expression values was symmetric or asymmetric. We found that this system is accurate, reproducible and comparable to other normalization methods when the distribution of the expression values is symmetric. In contrast, we found that the use of the spike-in normalization method is superior and necessary when the distribution of the gene expression is asymmetric and biased towards up-regulated genes. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that spike-in controls based normalization is a reliable and reproducible method that has the major advantage to be applicable also to biased platform where the distribution of the up- and down-regulated genes is asymmetric as it may occur in diagnostic chips.},

RESULTS: A total of 153 individuals attended for assessment (of 162 referred); 97 (63.4\%) were natal males and 56 (36.6\%) were natal females. Mean age at referral was markedly different between the two groups, with females being younger. The number of referral significantly increased over the time period, by an average of 18\% per year (95\% CI 1.08-1.30). Eighty-seven patients sought transition from male to female, and 46 from female to male, while a smaller group (n = 13) had non-binary presentations. Twelve patients (7.8\%) had autism spectrum disorder.Clinical implicationsThere are various possible reasons for the increased demand for services for people with gender dysphoria, which we discuss here. When planning services in the UK, both the increase in overall referral rates and the apparent earlier age at referral should be taken into account.Declaration of interestNone.},

Her prior ob-gyn had recently retired, and all of her patients had been transferred to the care of another doctor. CHJ was somewhat reluctant to be seen by a new ob-gyn but overcame her trepidation because her prior doctor had highly recommended him. She undressed, donned the requisite gown, and positioned herself on the examining table and in the stirrups with the help of a medical assistant. The doctor entered the room and briefly introduced himself. As CHJ was being examined, the physician looked up and asked if she was sexually active. CHJ responded yes and started to feel discomfited, wondering where this line of questioning was going. The physician said, ``Change to your fibroid is large. Haven't you experienced quite a bit of pain during sexual intercourse with your husband?'' CHJ tensed and simply replied, ``No, I haven't experienced any pain.''},

  abstract = {Background Improving care for people with long-term conditions is central to NHS policy. It has been suggested that the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), a primary care pay-for-performance scheme that rewards practices for delivering effective interventions in long-term conditions, does not encourage high-quality care for this group of patients. Aim To examine the evidence that the QOF has improved quality of care for patients with long-term conditions. Design and setting This was a systematic review of research on the effectiveness of the QOF in the UK. Method The authors searched electronic databases for peer-reviewed empirical quantitative research studying the effect of the QOF on a broad range of processes and outcomes of care, including coordination and integration of care, holistic and personalised care, self-care, patient experience, physiological and biochemical outcomes, health service utilisation, and mortality. Because the studies were heterogeneous, a narrative synthesis was carried out. Results The authors identified three systematic reviews and five primary research studies that met the inclusion criteria. The QOF was associated with a modest slowing of both the increase in emergency admissions and the increase in consultations in severe mental illness (SMI), and modest improvements in diabetes care. The nature of the evidence means that the authors cannot be sure that any of these associations is causal. No clear effect on mortality was found. The authors found no evidence that the QOF influences integration or coordination of care, holistic care, self-care, or patient experience. Conclusion The NHS should consider more broadly what constitutes high-quality primary care for people with long-term conditions, and consider other ways of motivating primary care to deliver it.},

  abstract = {Complete knowledge of all direct and indirect interactions between proteins in a  given cell would represent an important milestone towards a comprehensive description of cellular mechanisms and functions. Although this goal is still elusive, considerable progress has been made-particularly for certain model organisms and functional systems. Currently, protein interactions and associations are annotated at various levels of detail in online resources, ranging from raw data repositories to highly formalized pathway databases. For many applications, a global view of all the available interaction data is desirable, including lower-quality data and/or computational predictions. The STRING database (http://string-db.org/) aims to provide such a global perspective for as many organisms as feasible. Known and predicted associations are scored and integrated, resulting in comprehensive protein networks covering {$>$}1100 organisms. Here, we describe the update to version 9.1 of STRING, introducing several improvements: (i) we extend the automated mining of scientific texts for  interaction information, to now also include full-text articles; (ii) we entirely re-designed the algorithm for transferring interactions from one model organism to the other; and (iii) we provide users with statistical information on any functional enrichment observed in their networks.},

LGB older adults had higher risk of disability, poor mental health, smoking, and excessive drinking than did heterosexuals. Lesbians and bisexual women had higher risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity, and gay and bisexual men had higher risk of poor physical health and living alone than did heterosexuals. Lesbians reported a higher rate of excessive drinking than did bisexual women; bisexual men reported a higher rate of diabetes and a lower rate of being tested for HIV than did gay men., Conclusions. Tailored interventions are needed to address the health disparities and unique health needs of LGB older adults. Research across the life course is needed to better understand health disparities by sexual orientation and age, and to assess subgroup differences within these communities.},

  abstract = {Re-programming of metabolic pathways is a hallmark of physiological changes in cancer cells. The expression of certain genes that directly control the rate of key metabolic pathways including glycolysis, lipogenesis and nucleotide synthesis are drastically altered at different stages of tumor progression. These alterations are generally considered as an adaptation of tumor cells; however, they also contribute to the progression of tumor cells to become more aggressive phenotypes. This review summarizes the recent information about the mechanistic link of these genes to oncogenesis and their potential utility as diagnostic markers as well as for therapeutic targets. We particularly focus on three groups of genes; GLUT1, G6PD, TKTL1 and PGI/AMF in glycolytic pathway, ACLY, ACC1 and FAS in lipogenesis and RRM1, RRM2 and TYMS for nucleotide synthesis. All these genes are highly up-regulated in a variety of tumor cells in cancer patients, and they play active roles in tumor progression rather than expressing merely as a consequence of phenotypic change of the cancer cells. Molecular dissection of their orchestrated networks and understanding the exact mechanism of their expression will provide a window of opportunity to target these genes for specific cancer therapy. We also reviewed existing database of gene microarray to validate the utility of these genes for cancer diagnosis.},

  abstract = {To propose and test a simple instrument based on seven criteria of     study design to distinguish effectiveness (pragmatic) from efficacy (explanatory) trials while     conducting systematic reviews. , Currently, no validated definition of effectiveness studies exists. We     asked the directors of 12 Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPCs) to select six studies each:     four that they considered to be examples of effectiveness trials and two considered efficacy     studies. We then applied our proposed criteria to test the construct validity using the selected     studies as if they had been identified by a gold standard. , Based on the rationale to identify effectiveness studies reliably with     minimal false positives (i.e., a high specificity), a cut-off of six criteria produced the most     desirable balance between sensitivity and specificity. This setting produced a specificity of     0.83 and a sensitivity of 0.72. , When applied in a standardized manner, our proposed criteria can     provide a valid and simple tool to distinguish effectiveness from efficacy studies. The     applicability of systematic reviews can improve when analysts place more emphasis on the     generalizability of included studies. In addition, clinicians can also use our criteria to     determine the external validity of individual studies given an appropriate population of     interest.},

  abstract = {Background These `Social determinants of heath' (SDH) are non-clinical factors that profoundly impact health. Helping community health centers (CHCs) document patients' SDH data in electronic health records (EHRs) could yield substantial health benefits, but little has been reported about CHCs' development of EHR-based tools for SDH data collection and presentation. Methods We worked with 27 diverse CHC stakeholders to develop strategies for optimizing SDH data collection and presentation in their EHR, and approaches to integrating SDH data collection and use (e.g., through referrals to community resources) into CHC workflows. Results We iteratively developed a set of EHR-based SDH data collection, summary, and referral tools for CHCs. We describe considerations that arose during the tool development process, and present a number of preliminary lessons learned. Discussion Standardizing SDH data collection and presentation in EHRs could lead to improved patient and population health outcomes in CHCs and other care settings. We know of no previous reports on processes used to develop EHR-based SDH data tools. This paper provides an example of one such process. Conclusion Lessons from our process may be useful to healthcare organizations interested in using EHRs to collect and act on SDH data. Research is needed to empirically test the generalizability of these lessons.},

  abstract = {Electronic health records provide a potentially valuable data source of information for developing clinical prediction models. However, missing data are common in routinely collected health data and often missingness is informative. Informative missingness can be incorporated in a clinical prediction model, for example by including a separate category of a predictor variable that has missing values. The predictive performance of such a model depends on the transportability of the missing data mechanism, which may be compromised once the model is deployed in practice and the predictive value of certain variables becomes known. Using synthetic data, this phenomenon is explained and illustrated.},

  abstract = {Purpose Disordered weight management behaviors are prevalent among youth; recent case reports suggested that these behaviors might also be common in transgender youth. We studied associations of gender identity with disordered weight management behaviors, nonprescription steroid use, and weight perception among transgender and cisgender (nontransgender) high-school students in Massachusetts. Methods Data were analyzed from the 2013 Massachusetts Youth Health Survey, an anonymous survey in a random sample of Massachusetts public high schools. Respondents were divided into three groups: transgender (n~= 67), cisgender male (n~= 1,117), and cisgender female (n~= 1,289). Fisher's exact tests and multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine unhealthy weight management behaviors in the past 30~days: fasting {$>$}24~hours, vomiting, diet pill use, and laxative use; nonprescription steroid use; and self-perceived weight status. Analyses controlled for age, race/ethnicity, and body mass index. Results Compared with cisgender males, transgender adolescents had higher odds of fasting {$>$}24~hours (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]~= 2.9, confidence interval [CI]~= 1.1\textendash 7.8), using diet pills (AOR~= 8.9, 95\% CI~= 2.3\textendash 35.2) and taking laxatives (AOR~= 7.2, 95\% CI~= 1.4\textendash 38.4). Transgender youth had higher odds of lifetime use of steroids without a prescription than male cisgender respondents (AOR~= 26.6, 95\% CI~= 3.5\textendash 200.1). Compared with cisgender females, transgender respondents had higher odds of perceiving themselves as healthy weight/underweight when they were overweight/obese (AOR~= 2.4, 95\% CI~= 1.5\textendash 4.1). Conclusions Transgender youth disproportionately self-reported unsafe weight management behaviors and nonprescription steroid use compared with cisgender youth. Clinicians should be aware of this increased risk among transgender youth. Research is needed to further understand these disparities and to inform future interventions.},

  abstract = {Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number alteration (CNA) feature prominently in the somatic genomic landscape of tumours. As such, karyotypic aberrations in cancer genomes have been studied extensively to discover novel oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled the cost-effective detection of tumour genome and transcriptome mutation events at single base pair resolution; however, computational methods for predicting segmental regions of LOH in this context are not yet fully explored. Consequently, whole transcriptome, nucleotide-level resolution analysis of mono-allelic expression patterns associated with LOH has not yet been undertaken in cancer. We developed a novel approach for inference of LOH from paired tumour/normal sequence data and applied it to a cohort of 23 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) genomes. Following extensive benchmarking experiments, we describe the nucleotide-resolution landscape of LOH in TNBC and assess the consequent effect of LOH on the transcriptomes of these tumours using RNA-seq derived measurements of allele-specific expression. We show that the majority of mono-allelic expression in the transcriptomes of triple negative breast cancer can be explained by genomic regions of LOH, and establish a upper bound for mono-allelic expression that may be explained by other tumour-specific modifications such as epigenetics or mutations. Mono-allelically expressed genes associated with LOH reveals that cell-cycle, homologous recombination and actin-cytoskeletal functions are putatively disrupted by LOH in TNBC. Finally, we show how inference of LOH can be used to interpret allele frequencies of somatic mutations and postulate on temporal ordering of mutations in the evolutionary history of these tumours. Together, this contribution provides robust methodology and data to support the inclusion of LOH in the comprehensive characterization and interpretation of cancer genomes from sequencing data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bone is a frequent site for metastases among women with breast cancer. We conducted a study using the General Practice Research Database (GPRD), with linkage to the National Cancer Registry (NCR) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), to estimate the incidence of bone metastases in women with breast cancer in the United Kingdom. METHODS: We identified all women in the GPRD aged 20-99 with a first-time diagnosis of breast cancer between 2000 and 2006. To address potential underreporting, we developed and validated an algorithm to serve as a proxy for bone metastases. Bone metastases were defined as (1) a bone cancer diagnosis code on the same day or following breast cancer diagnosis date, or (2) another metastasis code plus codes consistent with bone metastases diagnosis or treatment using the algorithm. We sent questionnaires to a sample of general practitioners to validate these definitions. RESULTS: We included 13,207 breast cancer patients (median age at diagnosis of 61 years) who contributed 70,885 person-years of follow-up. The majority of patients had stage 1 or 2 breast cancer (90.4\%), and 2.6\% had metastatic breast cancer at diagnosis. We identified 788 women (6.0\%) with bone metastases after a median follow-up of 5.4 years. Questionnaire results validated the diagnosis of bone metastases in 88\% of patients with a bone cancer code and for 70\% identified with the algorithm. CONCLUSION: This is the first time the GPRD has been linked to HES and NCR to study the epidemiology of bone metastases, adding important information on the burden of bone metastasis.},

  abstract = {Polypharmacy, defined as regular use of at least five medications, is common in older adults and younger at-risk populations and increases the risk of adverse medical outcomes. There are several risk factors that can lead to polypharmacy. Patient-related factors include having multiple medical conditions managed by multiple subspecialist physicians, having chronic mental health conditions, and residing in a long-term care facility. Systems-level factors include poorly updated medical records, automated refill services, and prescribing to meet disease-specific quality metrics. Tools that help identify potentially inappropriate medication use include the Beers, STOPP (screening tool of older people's prescriptions), and START (screening tool to alert to right treatment) criteria, and the Medication Appropriateness Index. No one tool or strategy has been shown to be superior in improving patient-related outcomes and decreasing polypharmacy risks. Monitoring patients' active medication lists and deprescribing any unnecessary medications are recommended to reduce pill burden, the risks of adverse drug events, and financial hardship. Physicians should view deprescribing as a therapeutic intervention similar to initiating clinically appropriate therapy. When deprescribing, physicians should consider patient/ caregiver perspectives on goals of therapy, including views on medications and chronic conditions and preferences and priorities regarding prescribing to slow disease progression, prevent health decline, and address symptoms. Point-of-care tools can aid physicians in deprescribing and help patients understand the need to decrease medication burden to reduce the risks of polypharmacy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine (1) the positive predictive value (PPV) of multiple Read/OXMIS codes to identify incident acute myocardial infarction (AMI) cases in General Practice Research Database (GPRD); (2) the ability to capture the correct timing of the clinical event. METHODS: A random sample of 238 records (from 155 general practitioner (GP) practices) with AMI codes, between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2004, was selected from GPRD. Questionnaires were sent to the GPs to verify the diagnosis and timing of code-identified incident AMI events and collect supporting information. We calculated the PPV of the AMI codes as the proportion of code-identified AMIs that the GPs confirmed as AMI cases. Two physicians from Food and Drug administration (FDA), blinded to the GP response, reviewed the supporting hospital records returned by GPs for 98 AMI cases. RESULTS: A total of 217 questionnaires were completed (91\% response rate). The PPV of the AMI codes was 93\% (201/217). Thirty one (15\%) cases had a different event date than the one recorded in the electronic medical records (EMR); 28 (90\%) of the dates were within 15 days. One GP indicated that a patient had a previous AMI, 110 days before the codes that captured the AMI diagnosis. A total of 159 (79\%) AMI cases were hospitalized; hospital records were provided for 98 patients. Physician review of the hospital records found that 96\% of these records had enough information for classification, but not independent diagnosis, of AMI. CONCLUSIONS: Information in GPRD is sufficient to identify incident AMI cases and determine the event date with reasonable accuracy.},

Design Logistic regression models were applied to estimate parameters predicting past-year substance use disorder using the 2002\textendash 06 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data. We applied these parameters to the projected US 2020 population to estimate the number of adults aged 50 or older with substance use disorder in 2020. Setting Non-institutionalized US residences. Participants Representative sample of the US civilian, non-institutionalized population. Measurements Substance use disorder is classified based on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition. Findings Due to the large population size and high substance use rate of the baby-boom cohort, the number of adults aged 50 or older with substance use disorder is projected to double from 2.8 million (annual average) in 2002\textendash 06 to 5.7 million in 2020. Increases are projected for all examined gender, race/ethnicity and age groups. Conclusions Our estimates provide critical information for policymakers to allocate resources and develop prevention and treatment approaches to address future needs of the US older adult population with substance use disorder.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Binge drinking among older adults has increased in the past decade. Binge drinking is associated with unintentional injuries, medical conditions, and lower health-related quality of life. No studies have characterized multimorbidity among older binge drinkers. METHODS: We examined past 30-day binge alcohol use and lifetime medical conditions among adults age {$\geq$}50 from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2005 to 2014. Self-reported lifetime prevalence of 13 medical conditions and medical multimorbidity ({$\geq$}2 diseases) among binge drinkers were compared to non-binge drinkers. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine correlates of binge alcohol use among older adults with medical multimorbidity. RESULTS: Among adults aged {$\geq$}50, 14.4\% reported past-month binge drinking. Estimated prevalence of medical multimorbidity was lower (21.4\%) among binge drinkers than non-binge drinkers (28.3\%; p {$<$} 0.01). Binge drinkers were more likely to use tobacco and illegal drugs than non-binge drinkers (ps {$<$} 0.001). In the adjusted model, among older adults with multimorbidity, higher income (AOR = 1.44, p {$<$} 0.05), past-month tobacco use (AOR = 2.55, p {$<$} 0.001) and substance use disorder for illegal drugs (AOR = 1.80, p {$<$} 0.05) was associated with increased odds of binge alcohol use. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of multimorbidity was lower among current binge drinkers compared to non-binge drinkers, possibly because older adults in good health are apt to drink more than adults in poorer health. Current use of tobacco and substance use disorder were associated with an increased risk for binge drinking among older adults with multimorbidity. Binge drinking by older adults with multimorbidity may pose significant health risks especially with the concurrent use of other substances.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Anticholinergic burden (ACB), the cumulative effect of anticholinergic medications, is associated with adverse outcomes in older people but is less studied in middle-aged populations. Numerous scales exist to quantify ACB. The aims of this study were to quantify ACB in a large cohort using the 10 most common anticholinergic scales, to assess the association of each scale with adverse outcomes, and to assess overlap in populations identified by each scale. METHODS We performed a longitudinal analysis of the UK Biobank community cohort (502,538 participants, baseline age: 37-73 years, median years of follow-up: 6.2). The ACB was calculated at baseline using 10 scales. Baseline data were linked to national mortality register records and hospital episode statistics. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, MACE, hospital admission for fall/fracture, and hospital admission with dementia/delirium. Cox proportional hazards models (hazard ratio [HR], 95\% CI) quantified associations between ACB scales and outcomes adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol use, physical activity, and morbidity count. RESULTS Anticholinergic medication use varied from 8\% to 17.6\% depending on the scale used. For the primary outcome, ACB was significantly associated with all-cause mortality/MACE for each scale. The Anticholinergic Drug Scale was most strongly associated with mortality/MACE (HR = 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.11-1.14 per 1-point increase in score). The ACB was significantly associated with all secondary outcomes. The Anticholinergic Effect on Cognition scale was most strongly associated with dementia/delirium (HR = 1.45; 95\% CI, 1.3-1.61 per 1-point increase). CONCLUSIONS The ACB was associated with adverse outcomes in a middle- to older-aged population. Populations identified and effect size differed between scales. Scale choice influenced the population identified as potentially requiring reduction in ACB in clinical practice or intervention trials.},

  abstract = {Background Concerns have been raised that women from deprived backgrounds are less likely to be receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT) treatment and its benefits, although evidence in support of this is lacking. Aim To investigate general practice HRT prescription trends and their association with markers of socioeconomic deprivation. Design and setting Cross-sectional study of primary care prescribing data in England in 2018. Method Practice-level prescribing rate was defined as the number of items of HRT prescribed per 1000 registered female patients aged {$\geq$}40 years. The association between Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) score and HRT prescribing rate was tested using multivariate Poisson regression, adjusting for practice proportions of obesity, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, and practice list size. Results The overall prescribing rate of HRT was 29\% lower in practices from the most deprived quintile compared with the most affluent (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.71; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.68 to 0.73). After adjusting for all cardiovascular disease outcomes and risk factors, the prescribing rate in the most deprived quintile was still 18\% lower than in the least deprived quintile (adjusted IRR = 0.82; 95\% CI = 0.77 to 0.86). In more deprived practices, there was a significantly higher tendency to prescribe oral HRT than transdermal preparations (P{$<$}0.001). Conclusion This study highlights inequalities associated with HRT prescription. This may reflect a large unmet need in terms of menopause care in areas of deprivation. Further research is needed to identify the factors from patient and GP perspectives that may explain this.},

  abstract = {The MLL\textendash AF9 fusion gene is associated with aggressive leukemias of both the myeloid and lymphoid lineage in infants, whereas in adults, this translocation is mainly associated with acute myeloid leukemia. These observations suggest that differences exist between fetal and adult tissues in terms of the `cell of origin' from which the leukemia develops. Here we show that depending on extrinsic cues, human neonatal CD34+ cells are readily immortalized along either the myeloid or lymphoid lineage upon MLL\textendash AF9 expression and give rise to mainly lymphoid leukemia in immunocompromised mice. In contrast, immortalization of adult bone marrow CD34+ cells is more difficult to achieve and is myeloid-biased, even when MLL\textendash AF9 is expressed in purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Transcriptome analysis identified enrichment of HSC but not progenitor gene signatures in MLL\textendash AF9-expressing cells. Although not observed in adult cells, neonatal cells expressing MLL\textendash AF9 were enriched for gene signatures associated with poor prognosis, resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and MYC signaling. These results indicate that neonatal cells are inherently more prone to MLL\textendash AF9-mediated immortalization than adult cells and suggest that intrinsic properties of the cell of origin, in addition to extrinsic cues, dictate lineage of the immortalized cell.},

  abstract = {Measurement--the assignment of numbers to attributes of the natural world--is central to all scientific inference. Measurement theory concerns the relationship between measurements and reality; its goal is ensuring that inferences about measurements reflect the underlying reality we intend to represent. The key principle of measurement theory is that theoretical context, the rationale for collecting measurements, is essential to defining appropriate measurements and interpreting their values. Theoretical context determines the scale type of measurements and which transformations of those measurements can be made without  compromising their meaningfulness. Despite this central role, measurement theory  is almost unknown in biology, and its principles are frequently violated. In this review, we present the basic ideas of measurement theory and show how it applies  to theoretical as well as empirical work. We then consider examples of empirical  and theoretical evolutionary studies whose meaningfulness have been compromised by violations of measurement-theoretic principles. Common errors include not paying attention to theoretical context, inappropriate transformations of data, and inadequate reporting of units, effect sizes, or estimation error. The frequency of such violations reveals the importance of raising awareness of measurement theory among biologists.},

In addition to the large body of genetic, physiological and biochemical data gathered for this plant, it will be the first higher plant genome to be completely sequenced, with completion expected at the end of the year 2000. The sequencing effort has been coordinated by an international collaboration, the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI). The rationale for intensive investigation of Arabidopsis is that it is an excellent model for higher plants. In order to maximize use of the knowledge gained about this plant, there is a need for a comprehensive database and information retrieval and analysis system that will provide user-friendly access to Arabidopsis information. This paper describes the initial steps we have taken toward realizing these goals in a project called The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (www.arabidopsis.org).},

  abstract = {Serratia marcescens is an important nosocomial pathogen that can cause an array of infections, most notably of the urinary tract and bloodstream. Naturally, it is found in many environmental niches, and is capable of infecting plants and animals. The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant strains producing extended-spectrum or metallo beta-lactamases now pose a threat to public health worldwide. Here we report the complete genome sequences of two carefully selected S. marcescens strains, a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate (strain SM39) and an insect isolate (strain Db11). Our comparative analyses reveal the core genome  of S. marcescens and define the potential metabolic capacity, virulence, and multidrug resistance of this species. We show a remarkable intraspecies genetic diversity, both at the sequence level and with regards genome flexibility, which  may reflect the diversity of niches inhabited by members of this species. A broader analysis with other Serratia species identifies a set of approximately 3,000 genes that characterize the genus. Within this apparent genetic diversity,  we identified many genes implicated in the high virulence potential and antibiotic resistance of SM39, including the metallo beta-lactamase and multiple  other drug resistance determinants carried on plasmid pSMC1. We further show that pSMC1 is most closely related to plasmids circulating in Pseudomonas species. Our data will provide a valuable basis for future studies on S. marcescens and new insights into the genetic mechanisms that underlie the emergence of pathogens highly resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents.},

  abstract = {Clonal level random allelic expression imbalance and random monoallelic expression provides cellular heterogeneity within tissues by modulating allelic dosage. Although such expression patterns have been observed in multiple cell types, little is known about when in development these stochastic allelic choices are made. We examine allelic expression patterns in human neural progenitor cells before and after epigenetic reprogramming to induced pluripotency, observing that loci previously characterized by random allelic expression imbalance (0.63\% of expressed genes) are generally reset to a biallelic state in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We subsequently neuralized the iPSCs and profiled isolated clonal neural stem cells, observing that significant random allelic expression imbalance is reestablished at 0.65\% of expressed genes, including novel loci not found to show allelic expression imbalance in the original parental neural progenitor cells. Allelic expression imbalance was associated with altered DNA methylation across promoter regulatory regions, with clones characterized by skewed allelic expression being hypermethylated compared to their biallelic sister clones. Our results suggest that random allelic expression imbalance is established during lineage commitment and is associated with increased DNA methylation at the gene promoter.},

SOAPfuse applies an improved partial exhaustion algorithm to construct a library of fusion junction sequences, which can be used to efficiently identify fusion events, and employs a series of filters to nominate high-confidence fusion transcripts. Compared with other released tools, SOAPfuse achieves higher detection efficiency and consumed less computing resources. We applied SOAPfuse to RNA-Seq data from two bladder cancer cell lines, and confirmed 15 fusion transcripts, including several novel events common to both cell lines. SOAPfuse is available at                   http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapfuse.html                                  .},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Prostate cancer cell lines have been used in the search for biomarkers that are suitable for prostate cancer diagnosis. Unfortunately, many cell line studies have only involved single cell lines, partially characterized cell lines or were performed without controls, and this may have been detrimental to effective biomarker discovery. We have analyzed a panel of prostate cancer and nonmalignant control cell lines using current biomarkers and then investigated a set of prospective endosomal and lysosomal proteins to search for new biomarkers. METHODS Western blotting was used to define the amount of protein and specific molecular forms in cell extracts and culture media from a panel of nonmalignant (RWPE-1, PNT1a, PNT2) and prostate cancer (22RV1, CaHPV10, DU-145, LNCaP) cell lines. Gene expression was determined by qRT-PCR. RESULTS HPV-18 transfected cell lines displayed a different pattern of protein and gene expression when compared to the other cell lines examined, suggesting that these cell lines may not be the most optimal for prostate cancer biomarker discovery. There was an increased amount of prostatic acid phosphatase and kallikrein proteins in LNCaP cell extracts and culture media, but variable amounts of these proteins in other prostate cancer cell lines. There were minimal differences in the amounts of lysosomal proteins detected in prostate cancer cells and culture media, but two endosomal proteins, cathepsin B and acid ceramidase, had increased gene and protein expression, and certain molecular forms showed increased secretion from prostate cancer cells (P\,{$\leq$}\,0.05). LIMP-2 gene and protein expression was significantly increased in prostate cancer compared to nonmalignant cell lines (P\,{$\leq$}\,0.05). CONCLUSIONS While the existing prostate cancer biomarkers and lysosomal proteins investigated here were not able to specifically differentiate between a panel of nonmalignant and prostate cancer cell lines, endosomal proteins showed some discriminatory capacity. LIMP-2 is a critical regulator of endosome biogenesis and the increased expression observed in prostate cancer cells indicated that other endosome related proteins may also be upregulated and could be investigated as novel biomarkers.

It will specifically address obstacles and opportunities to using health data by collating, developing, and promoting best practices in information governance and in semantic interoperability. It will help to sustain and propagate the results of health information and communication technology (ICT) research that enables better use of health data, assessing and optimizing their novel value wherever possible. i HD has been formed after wide consultation and engagement of many stakeholders to develop methods, solutions, and services that can help to maximize the value obtained by all stakeholders from health data. It will support innovations in health maintenance, health care delivery, and knowledge discovery while ensuring compliance with all legal prerequisites, especially regarding the insurance of patient's privacy protection. It is bringing multiple stakeholder groups together so as to ensure that future solutions serve their collective needs and can be readily adopted affordably and at scale.},

  abstract = {Background:Increasing numbers of adolescents are seeking treatment from gender identity services, particularly natal girls. It is known from survey studies some adolescents exaggerate their belonging to minorities, thereby distorting prevalence estimates and findings on related problems. The aim of the present study was to explore the susceptibility of gender identity to mischievous responding, and prevalences of cis-gender, opposite-sex and other/ non-binary gender identities as corrected for likely mischievous responding among Finnish adolescents.Method:The School Health Promotion Survey 2017 data was used, comprising data on 135,760 adolescents under 21 years (mean 15.73, ds 1.3 years), 50.6\% females and 49.4\% males. Sex and perceived gender were elicited and gender identities classified based thereon. Likely mischievous responding was analysed using inappropriate responses to biodata and handicaps.Results:Of the participants, 3.5\% had most likely given facetious responses, boys more commonly than girls, and younger adolescents more commonly than older. This particularly concerned reporting of non-binary gender identity. Corrected prevalence of opposite-sex identification was 0.6\% and that of non-binary identification was 3.3\%. In boys, displaying non-binary gender identity increased from early to late adolescence, while among girls, opposite-sex and non-binary identifications decreased in prevalence from younger to older age groups.Conclusion:Prevalence of gender identities contrary to one's natal sex was more common than expected.},

In children, male:female birth sex ratio was even; in adolescents, a preponderance of females (birth sex) was observed, particularly in Finland.Conclusions: The demand for GIDSs has evolved similarly across Nordic countries and the UK. The reasons for the increase are not known but increased awareness of gender identity issues, service availability, destigmatization as well as social and media influences may play a role.},

To infer isoform regulation from high-throughput sequencing of cDNA fragments (RNA-seq), we developed the mixture-of-isoforms (MISO) model, a statistical model that estimates expression of alternatively spliced exons and isoforms and assesses confidence in these estimates. Incorporation of mRNA fragment length distribution in paired-end RNA-seq greatly improved estimation of alternative-splicing levels. MISO also detects differentially regulated exons or isoforms. Application of MISO implicated the RNA splicing factor hnRNP H1 in the regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation, a role that was supported by UV cross-linking\textendash immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) analysis in human cells. Our results provide a probabilistic framework for RNA-seq analysis, give functional insights into pre-mRNA processing and yield guidelines for the optimal design of RNA-seq experiments for studies of gene and isoform expression.},

Microarray experiments have multiple sources of variation, and experimental plans should ensure that effects of interest are not confounded with ancillary effects. A commonly used design is shown to violate this principle and to be generally inefficient. We explore the connection between microarray designs and classical block design and use a family of ANOVA models as a guide to choosing a design. We combine principles of good design and A-optimality to give a general set of recommendations for design with microarrays. These recommendations are illustrated in detail for one kind of experimental objective, where we also give the results of a computer search for good designs.},

HISAT uses an indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, employing two types of indexes for alignment: a whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local FM indexes for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISAT's hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of [sim]64,000 bp. Tests on real and simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than any other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT requires only 4.3 gigabytes of memory. HISAT supports genomes of any size, including those larger than 4 billion bases.},

  abstract = {With the EU General Data Protection Regulation entering into force in 2018, the stage is set for international debate on Big Data sharing in health. Considering the fact that health data (and especially genetic data) are considered ``sensitive'', is there a way to structure the debate on the barriers, and risk-benefit ratio that moves away from the traditional pros and cons of potential privacy and discrimination risks? Potential discrimination has been addressed in legislation and the balancing of privacy rights against the potential benefits of data sharing in intensive science is leading to a more proportionate approach. We postulate that an important catalyst that will further shift this debate from its traditional contours would be to activate the ``right to science'' as enshrined in international law. Of note, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health has developed a Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomics and Health-Related Data based on that human right. Similarly, recent guidelines from the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, as well as from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics contain provisions that promote data sharing indicating that data intensive science may gradually come to be founded on a more communal ethos.},

  abstract = {Background Health care for transgender and transsexual (ie, trans) individuals has long been based on a binary understanding of gender (ie, feminine vs masculine). However, the existence of non-binary or genderqueer (NBGQ) genders is increasingly recognized by academic and/or health care professionals. Aim To gain insight into the individual health care experiences and needs of binary and NBGQ individuals to improve their health care outcomes and experience. Methods Data were collected using an online survey study on experiences with trans health care. The non-clinical sample consisted of 415 trans individuals. An individual treatment progress score was calculated to report and compare participants' individual progress toward treatment completion and consider the individual treatment needs and definitions of completed treatment (ie, amount and types of different treatments needed to complete one's medical transition). Outcomes Main outcome measures were (i) general and trans-related sociodemographic data and (ii) received and planned treatments. Results Participants reported binary (81.7\%) and different NBGQ (18.3\%) genders. The 2 groups differed significantly in basic demographic data (eg, mean age; P {$<$} .05). NBGQ participants reported significantly fewer received treatments compared with binary participants. For planned treatments, binary participants reported more treatments related to primary sex characteristics only. Binary participants required more treatments for a completed treatment than NBGQ participants (6.0 vs 4.0). There were no differences with regard to individual treatment progress score. Clinical Translation Because traditional binary-focused treatment practice could have hindered NBGQ individuals from accessing trans health care or sufficiently articulating their needs, health care professionals are encouraged to provide a holistic and individual treatment approach and acknowledge genders outside the gender binary to address their needs appropriately. Strengths and Limitations Because the study was made inclusive for non-patients and individuals who decided against trans health care, bias from a participant-patient double role was prevented, which is the reason the results are likely to have a higher level of validity than a clinical sample. However, because of the anonymity of an online survey, it remains unclear whether NBGQ individuals live according to their gender identity in their everyday life. Conclusion The study highlights the broad spectrum of genders in trans-individuals and associated health care needs and provides a novel approach to measure individual treatment progress in trans individuals.

Two important questions are whether all lncRNAs are functional and how they could exert a function. Several lncRNAs have been shown to function through their product, but this is not the only possible mode of action. In this review we focus on a role for the process of lncRNA transcription, independent of the lncRNA product, in regulating protein-coding-gene activity in cis. We discuss examples where lncRNA transcription leads to gene silencing or activation, and describe strategies to determine if the lncRNA product or its transcription causes the regulatory effect.},

Hence, we aimed to map the course of human health by identifying the 50 most common health conditions in each decade of life and estimating the median age at first diagnosis.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We developed phenotyping algorithms and codelists for physical and mental health conditions that involve intensive use of health-care resources. Individuals older than 1 year were included in the study if their primary-care and hospital-admission records met research standards set by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and they had been registered in a general practice in England contributing up-to-standard data for at least 1 year during the study period. We used linked records of individuals from the CALIBER platform to calculate the sex-standardised cumulative incidence for these conditions by 10-year age groups between April 1, 2010, and March 31, 2015. We also derived the median age at diagnosis and prevalence estimates stratified by age, sex, and ethnicity (black, white, south Asian) over the study period from the primary-care and secondary-care records of patients.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We developed case definitions for 308 disease phenotypes. We used records of 2 784 138 patients for the calculation of cumulative incidence and of 3 872 451 patients for the calculation of period prevalence and median age at diagnosis of these conditions. Conditions that first gained prominence at key stages of life were: atopic conditions and infections that led to hospital admission in children ({$<$}10 years); acne and menstrual disorders in the teenage years (10\textendash 19 years); mental health conditions, obesity, and migraine in individuals aged 20\textendash 29 years; soft-tissue disorders and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in individuals aged 30\textendash 39 years; dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and erectile dysfunction in individuals aged 40\textendash 59 years; cancer, osteoarthritis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, cataract, diverticular disease, type 2 diabetes, and deafness in individuals aged 60\textendash 79 years; and atrial fibrillation, dementia, acute and chronic kidney disease, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, anaemia, and osteoporosis in individuals aged 80 years or older. Black or south-Asian individuals were diagnosed earlier than white individuals for 258 (84\%) of the 308 conditions. Bone fractures and atopic conditions were recorded earlier in male individuals, whereas female individuals were diagnosed at younger ages with nutritional anaemias, tubulointerstitial nephritis, and urinary disorders.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We have produced the first chronological map of human health with cumulative-incidence and period-prevalence estimates for multiple morbidities in parallel from birth to advanced age. This can guide clinicians, policy makers, and researchers on how to formulate differential diagnoses, allocate resources, and target research priorities on the basis of the knowledge of who gets which diseases when. We have published our phenotyping algorithms on the CALIBER open-access Portal which will facilitate future research by providing a curated list of reusable case definitions.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Wellcome Trust, National Institute for Health Research, Medical Research Council, Arthritis Research UK, British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK, Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorates, Department of Health and Social Care (England), Health and Social Care Research and Development Division (Welsh Government), Public Health Agency (Northern Ireland), Economic and Social Research Council, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, National Institute for Social Care and Health Research, and The Alan Turing Institute.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Interpretation of high-throughput genomics data based on biological pathways constitutes a constant challenge, partly because of the lack of supporting pathway database. In this study, we created a functional genomics knowledgebase in mouse, which includes 33,261 pathways and gene sets compiled from 40 sources such as Gene Ontology, KEGG, GeneSetDB, PANTHER, microRNA and transcription factor target genes, etc. In addition, we also manually collected and curated 8,747 lists of differentially expressed genes from 2,526 published gene expression studies to enable the detection of similarity to previously reported gene expression signatures. These two types of data constitute a Gene Set Knowledgebase (GSKB), which can be readily used by various pathway analysis software such as gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Using our knowledgebase, we were able to detect the correct microRNA (miR-29) pathway that was suppressed using antisense oligonucleotides and confirmed its role in inhibiting fibrogenesis, which might involve upregulation of transcription factor SMAD3. The knowledgebase can be queried as a source of published gene lists for further meta-analysis. Through meta-analysis of 56 published gene lists related to retina cells, we revealed two fundamentally different types of gene expression changes. One is related to stress and inflammatory response blamed for causing blindness in many diseases; the other associated with visual perception by normal retina cells. GSKB is available online at http://ge-lab.org/gs/, and also as a Bioconductor package (gskb, https://bioconductor.org/packages/gskb/). This database enables in-depth interpretation of mouse genomics data both in terms of known pathways and the context of thousands of published expression signatures.},

  abstract = {The most widely used and influential typologies for transsexualism and gender identity disorder (GID) in adolescents and adults employ either sexual orientation or age of onset of GID-related symptoms as bases for categorization. This review compares these two typological approaches, with the goal of determining which one should be employed for the diagnosis of GID in Adolescents or Adults (or its successor diagnosis) in the forthcoming revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Typologies based on sexual orientation and age of onset of GID-related symptoms are roughly comparable in ease and reliability of subtype assignment. Typologies based on sexual orientation, however, employ subtypes that are less ambiguous and better suited to objective confirmation and that offer more concise, comprehensive clinical description. Typologies based on sexual orientation are also superior in their ability to predict treatment-related outcomes and comorbid psychopathology and to facilitate research. Commonly expressed objections to typologies based on sexual orientation are unpersuasive when examined closely. The DSM should continue to employ subtypes based on sexual orientation for the diagnosis of GID in Adolescents or Adults or its successor diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Thirty-one years after living full time as a woman, a 53-year-old skilled machinist returned to have therapy with me, a psychiatrist, because of a decision to return to living as a man. As our work together continued, I suggested to this would-be published novelist that others might benefit from his experience. This led to his posting an extensive account of his life in September 2016 on Gender Trender. Now living in good mental and physical health as a male, he has given me permission to discuss his initial presentation, my understanding of his motivations, and to reflect on the broader questions that his life rises for the field of transgenderism. This report describes regret, defenses against regret, and a dramatic 3-day catharsis followed by the patient's first loving relationship. He now ironically reflects that he escaped from the sensed inauthenticity of his youthful maleness only to create a felt inauthentic feminine social psychological state. The professional literature about the long-term outcome of the transgendered who do not have surgery is largely nonexistent in English. Anecdotal accounts, however, are readily accessible on the Internet.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped  alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when  the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

However, in applications of the next-generation sequencing (NGS), accurate genotypes may not be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or somatic mutation discovery). These applications press for the development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with uncertainty. RESULTS: We present a statistical framework for calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring population genetical parameters and performing association tests directly based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or linkage-based imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping. We also highlight the necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events, mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors.

  abstract = {The Notch pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating cell fate decisions in many  stem cell systems. However, the full repertoire of Notch target genes in vivo and the mechanisms through which this pathway activity is integrated with other signaling pathways are largely unknown. Here, we report a transgenic mouse in which the activation of the Notch pathway massively expands the neural stem cell  (NSC) pool in a cell context-dependent manner. Using this in vivo system, we identify direct targets of RBPJ/N1ICD in cortical NSCs at a genome-wide level through combined ChIP-Seq and transcriptome analyses. Through a highly conservative analysis of these datasets, we identified 98 genes that are directly regulated by N1ICD/RPBJ in vivo. These include many transcription factors that are known to be critical for NSC self-renewal (Sox2, Pax6, Tlx, and Id4) and the  transcriptional effectors of the Wnt, SHH, and Hippo pathways, TCF4, Gli2, Gli3,  Yap1, and Tead2. Since little is known about the function of the Hippo-Yap pathway in NSCs, we analyzed Yap1 expression and function in NSCs. We show that Yap1 expression is restricted to the stem cell compartment in the developing forebrain and that its expression is sufficient to rescue Notch pathway inhibition in NSC self-renewal assays. Together, results of this study reveal a previously underappreciated complexity and breadth of Notch1 targets in vivo and  show direct interaction between Notch and Hippo-Yap pathways in NSCs.},

We performed an unbiased analysis of transcriptional heterogeneity in colorectal tumors and their microenvironments using single-cell RNA\textendash seq from 11 primary colorectal tumors and matched normal mucosa. To robustly cluster single-cell transcriptomes, we developed reference component analysis (RCA), an algorithm that substantially improves clustering accuracy. Using RCA, we identified two distinct subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Additionally, epithelial\textendash mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes were found to be upregulated only in the CAF subpopulation of tumor samples. Notably, colorectal tumors previously assigned to a single subtype on the basis of bulk transcriptomics could be divided into subgroups with divergent survival probability by using single-cell signatures, thus underscoring the prognostic value of our approach. Overall, our results demonstrate that unbiased single-cell RNA\textendash seq profiling of tumor and matched normal samples provides a unique opportunity to characterize aberrant cell states within a tumor.},

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction with QRISK3 was used as exemplar. The study included 3.6 million patients in 392 sites from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Cox models with QRISK3 predictors and a frailty (random effect) term for each site were used to incorporate unmeasured site variability. There was considerable variation in data recording between general practices (missingness of body mass index ranged from 18.7\% to 60.1\%). Incidence rates varied considerably between practices (from 0.4 to 1.3 CVD events per 100 patient-years). Individual CVD risk predictions with the random effect model were inconsistent with the QRISK3 predictions. For patients with QRISK3 predicted risk of 10\%, the 95\% range of predicted risks were between 7.2\% and 13.7\% with the random effects model. Random variability only explained a small part of this. The random effects model was equivalent to QRISK3 for discrimination and calibration. Risk prediction models based on routinely collected health data perform well for populations but with great uncertainty for individuals. Clinicians and patients need to understand this uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The eIF2{$\alpha$} (eukaryotic initiation factor-2{$\alpha$}) kinase PERK (doublestranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase) is essential for the normal function of highly secretory cells in the pancreas and skeletal system, as well as the UPR (unfolded protein response) in mammalian cells. To delineate the regulatory machinery underlying PERK-dependent stress-responses, gene profiling was employed to assess global changes in gene expression in PERK-deficient MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts). Several IE (immediate-early) genes, including c-myc, c-jun, egr-1 (early growth response factor-1), and fra-1 (fos-related antigen-1), displayed PERK-dependent expression in MEFs upon disruption of calcium homoeostasis by inhibiting the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) transmembrane SERCA (sarcoplasmic/ER Ca2+-ATPase) calcium pump. Induction of c-myc and egr-1 by other reagents that elicit the UPR, however, showed variable dependence upon PERK. Induction of c-myc expression by thapsigargin was shown to be linked to key signalling enzymes including PLC (phospholipase C), PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase). Analysis of the phosphorylated status of major components in MAPK signalling pathways indicated that thapsigargin and DTT (dithiothreitol) but not tunicamycin could trigger the PERK-dependent activation of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 MAPK. However, activation of JNK and p38 MAPK by non-ER stress stimuli including UV irradiation, anisomycin, and TNF-{$\alpha$} (tumour necrosis factor-{$\alpha$}) was found to be independent of PERK. PERK plays a particularly important role in mediating the global cellular response to ER stress that is elicited by the depletion of calcium from the ER. We suggest that this specificity of PERK function in the UPR is an extension of the normal physiological function of PERK to act as a calcium sensor in the ER.},

Nonetheless, hARD1 has been reported to bind directly with HIF-1{$\alpha$}. Here, we addressed the functional significance of the hARD1\textendash HIF-1{$\alpha$} interaction. Because hARD1 acetylates and activates {$\beta$}-catenin, we examined whether HIF-1{$\alpha$} regulates the hARD1-mediated activation of Wnt signaling. It was found that HIF-1{$\alpha$} binds hARD1 through the oxygen-dependent degradation domain and, in so doing, dissociates hARD1 from {$\beta$}-catenin, which prevents {$\beta$}-catenin acetylation. In LiCl-stimulated HEK293 or cancer cell lines with active Wnt signaling, {$\beta$}-catenin acetylation and activity were suppressed in hypoxia, and these suppressions were mediated by HIF-1{$\alpha$}. Moreover, HIF-1{$\alpha$} disruption of hARD1/{$\beta$}-catenin repressed TCF4 activity, resulting in c-Myc suppression and p21cip1 induction. In addition, we confirmed that the HIF-1{$\alpha$} NH2 terminal inactivates TCF4 by directly binding {$\beta$}-catenin. In conclusion, HIF-1{$\alpha$} was found to inactivate the Wnt signaling by binding to hARD1 or {$\beta$}-catenin, which may contribute to the hypoxia-induced growth arrest of tumor cells.

  abstract = {Purpose In on-line forums, parents have reported that their children seemed to experience a sudden or rapid onset of gender dysphoria, appearing for the first time during puberty or even after its completion. Parents describe that the onset of gender dysphoria seemed to occur in the context of belonging to a peer group where one, multiple, or even all of the friends have become gender dysphoric and transgender-identified during the same timeframe. Parents also report that their children exhibited an increase in social media/internet use prior to disclosure of a transgender identity. Recently, clinicians have reported that post-puberty presentations of gender dysphoria in natal females that appear to be rapid in onset is a phenomenon that they are seeing more and more in their clinic. Academics have raised questions about the role of social media in the development of gender dysphoria. The purpose of this study was to collect data about parents' observations, experiences, and perspectives about their adolescent and young adult (AYA) children showing signs of an apparent sudden or rapid onset of gender dysphoria that began during or after puberty, and develop hypotheses about factors that may contribute to the onset and/or expression of gender dysphoria among this demographic group. Methods For this descriptive, exploratory study, recruitment information with a link to a 90-question survey, consisting of multiple-choice, Likert-type and open-ended questions was placed on three websites where parents had reported sudden or rapid onsets of gender dysphoria occurring in their teen or young adult children. The study's eligibility criteria included parental response that their child had a sudden or rapid onset of gender dysphoria and parental indication that their child's gender dysphoria began during or after puberty. To maximize the chances of finding cases meeting eligibility criteria, the three websites (4thwavenow, transgender trend, and youthtranscriticalprofessionals) were selected for targeted recruitment. Website moderators and potential participants were encouraged to share the recruitment information and link to the survey with any individuals or communities that they thought might include eligible participants to expand the reach of the project through snowball sampling techniques. Data were collected anonymously via SurveyMonkey. Quantitative findings are presented as frequencies, percentages, ranges, means and/or medians. Open-ended responses from two questions were targeted for qualitative analysis of themes. Results There were 256 parent-completed surveys that met study criteria. The AYA children described were predominantly natal female (82.8\%) with a mean age of 16.4 years at the time of survey completion and a mean age of 15.2 when they announced a transgender-identification. Per parent report, 41\% of the AYAs had expressed a non-heterosexual sexual orientation before identifying as transgender. Many (62.5\%) of the AYAs had reportedly been diagnosed with at least one mental health disorder or neurodevelopmental disability prior to the onset of their gender dysphoria (range of the number of pre-existing diagnoses 0\textendash 7). In 36.8\% of the friendship groups described, parent participants indicated that the majority of the members became transgender-identified. Parents reported subjective declines in their AYAs' mental health (47.2\%) and in parent-child relationships (57.3\%) since the AYA ``came out'' and that AYAs expressed a range of behaviors that included: expressing distrust of non-transgender people (22.7\%); stopping spending time with non-transgender friends (25.0\%); trying to isolate themselves from their families (49.4\%), and only trusting information about gender dysphoria from transgender sources (46.6\%). Most (86.7\%) of the parents reported that, along with the sudden or rapid onset of gender dysphoria, their child either had an increase in their social media/internet use, belonged to a friend group in which one or multiple friends became transgender-identified during a similar timeframe, or both Conclusion This descriptive, exploratory study of parent reports provides valuable detailed information that allows for the generation of hypotheses about factors that may contribute to the onset and/or expression of gender dysphoria among AYAs. Emerging hypotheses include the possibility of a potential new subcategory of gender dysphoria (referred to as rapid-onset gender dysphoria) that has not yet been clinically validated and the possibility of social influences and maladaptive coping mechanisms. Parent-child conflict may also explain some of the findings. More research that includes data collection from AYAs, parents, clinicians and third party informants is needed to further explore the roles of social influence, maladaptive coping mechanisms, parental approaches, and family dynamics in the development and duration of gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in American men and there is an unmet need for biomarkers to identify patients with aggressive disease. In an effort to identify biomarkers of recurrence, we performed global RNA sequencing on 106 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostatectomy samples from 100 patients at three independent sites, defining a 24-gene signature panel. The 24 genes in this panel function in cell-cycle progression, angiogenesis, hypoxia, apoptosis, PI3K signaling, steroid metabolism, translation, chromatin modification, and transcription. Sixteen genes have been associated with cancer, with five specifically associated with prostate cancer (BTG2, IGFBP3, SIRT1, MXI1, and FDPS). Validation was performed on an independent publicly available dataset of 140 patients, where the new signature panel outperformed markers published previously in terms of predicting biochemical recurrence. Our work also identified differences in gene expression between Gleason pattern 4 + 3 and 3 + 4 tumors, including several genes involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and developmental pathways. Overall, this study defines a novel biomarker panel that has the potential to improve the clinical management of prostate cancer. Cancer Res; 74(12); 3228\textendash 37. \textcopyright 2014 AACR.},

  abstract = {External RNA spike-in control ratio abundance mixtures enable assessment of technical performance of a gene expression experiment and comparison of performance between gene expression experiments. We've developed an R package, the ``erccdashboard'', to analyze ratio abundance mixtures of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) controls for the purpose of gene expression experiment method validation. For RNA-Seq, analysis of sequence reads with existing QC metrics provides an assessment of sequencing and mapped read quality, the analysis of ERCC control ratio mixtures is intended to provide QC metrics that are relevant for gene expression analysis methods including transcript quantification and differential expression testing. The erccdashboard package addresses this critical analysis need with QC metrics for gene expression experiments including dynamic range, biases and variability in ratio measurements, diagnostic performance (discrimination of true positive and true negative controls), and empirical determination of the limit of detection of ratios. Using the erccdashboard package quantitative differences between these ratio measurement performance metrics were shown for experiments within the same laboratory, between different laboratories, and for different gene expression measurement technologies (sequencing platforms and microarrays). The ERCC control ratio measurements also provide a quantification of biases that may be addressed with normalization approaches, such as differences in mRNA fraction of total RNA for a pair of gene expression experiment samples and batch effects. The erccdashboard R software package is freely available and may be adopted as part of the QC process for any gene expression measurement analysis pipeline.},

  abstract = {There is now evidence that major depression (MDD) is accompanied by an activation of the inflammatory response system (IRS) and that pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysacharide (LPS) may induce depressive symptoms. The aim of the present study was to examine whether an increased gastrointestinal permeability with an increased translocation of LPS from gram negative bacteria may play a role in the pathophysiology of MDD. Toward this end, the present study examines the serum concentrations of IgM and IgA against LPS of the gram-negative enterobacteria, Hafnia Alvei, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, Morganella Morganii, Pseudomonas Putida, Citrobacter Koseri, and Klebsielle Pneumoniae in MDD patients and normal controls. We found that the prevalences and median values for serum IgM and IgA against LPS of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with MDD than in normal volunteers. These differences are significant to the extent that a significant diagnostic performance is obtained, i.e. the area under the ROC curve is 90.1\%. The symptom profiles of increased IgM and IgA levels are fatigue, autonomic and gastro-intestinal symptoms and a subjective feeling of infection. The results show that intestinal mucosal dysfunction characterized by an increased translocation of gram-negative bacteria (leaky gut) plays a role in the inflammatory pathophysiology of depression. It is suggested that the increased LPS translocation may mount an immune response and thus IRS activation in some patients with MDD and may induce specific "sickness behaviour" symptoms. It is suggested that patients with MDD should be checked for leaky gut by means of the IgM and IgA panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for leaky gut.},

Other studies had shown that bone marrow (BM)\textendash derived cells injected into the injured heart could improve its function, at least in animal models,2 but the cardiac stem cell was expected to be more likely to differentiate into cardiomyocytes than cells derived from organs other than the heart, such as the BM or the adipose tissue. In keeping, a recent study confirmed a higher regenerative potential of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) compared with BM-derived stem cells in a mouse model of myocardial infarction.3 Article, see p 1253 Since the initial discovery of the c-kit+ cardiac stem cell, other cardiac stem cell and CPC populations have been identified. In rodents, different CPCs have been isolated on the basis of the expression of stem cell antigen 1 (Sca1)4,5 and their ability to actively extrude dyes and toxic compounds through the ATP-binding cassette surface transporter,6 identifying in this way a cardiac resident side population (SP). Islet 1\textendash positive cardiac stem cells have been found in postnatal heart7; however, it is unclear whether these cells are present in the adult heart.8 In addition to these cell populations, cardiac-derived spheroidal aggregates named cardiospheres9 have been obtained from the heart of different species.

We have investigated the role of polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor populations. We show that mice with loss of function mutations in PRC2 components display enhanced HSC/progenitor population activity, whereas mutations that disrupt PRC1 or pleiohomeotic repressive complex are associated with HSC/progenitor cell defects. Because the hierarchical model of PRC action would predict synergistic effects of PRC1 and PRC2 mutation, these opposing effects suggest this model does not hold true in HSC/progenitor cells. To investigate the molecular targets of each complex in HSC/progenitor cells, we measured genome-wide expression changes associated with PRC deficiency, and identified transcriptional networks that are differentially regulated by PRC1 and PRC2. These studies provide new insights into the mechanistic interplay between distinct PRCs and have important implications for approaching PcG proteins as therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Stigma leads to poorer health. Edited by Brenda Major, John F. Dovidio, and Bruce G. Link, The Oxford Handbook of Stigma, Discrimination, and Health provides compelling evidence from various disciplines in support of this thesis and explains how and why health disparities exist and persist. Stigmatization involves distinguishing people by a socially conferred "mark," seeing them as deviant, and devaluing and socially excluding them. The core insight of this book is that the social processes of stigma reliably translate into the biology of disease and death. Contributors elucidate this insight by showing exactly how stigma negatively affects health and creates health disparities through multiple mechanisms operating at different levels of influence. Understanding the causes and consequences of health disparities requires a multi-level analysis that considers structural forces, psychological processes, and biological mechanisms. This volume's unique multidisciplinary approach brings together social and health psychologists, sociologists, public health scholars, and medical ethicists to comprehensively assess stigma's impact on health. It goes beyond the common practice of studying one stigmatized group at a time to examine the stigma-health link across multiple stigmatized groups. This broad, multidisciplinary framework not only illuminates the significant effects stigma has when aggregated across the health of many groups but also increases understanding of which stigma processes are general across groups and which are particular to specific groups. Here, a compendium of leading international experts point readers toward potential policy responses and possibilities for intervention as well as to the large gaps in understanding that remain. This book is the definitive source of scholarship on stigma and physical health for established and emerging scholars, practitioners, and students in psychology, sociology, public health, medicine, law, political science, geography, and the allied disciplines.},

  abstract = {Having lived through both World Wars, Jung was aware of the dangers of what he termed ``psychic epidemics.'' He discussed the spontaneous manifestation of an archetype within collective life as indicative of a critical time during which there is a serious risk of a destructive psychic epidemic.\hspace{1em}Currently, we appear to be experiencing a significant psychic epidemic that is manifesting as children and young people coming to believe that they are the opposite sex, and in some cases taking drastic measures to change their bodies. Of particular concern to the author is the number of teens and tweens suddenly coming out as transgender without a prior history of discomfort with their sex.``Rapid-onset gender dysphoria'' is a new presentation of a condition that has not been well studied. Reports online indicate that a young person's coming out as transgender is often preceded by increased social media use and/or having one or more peers also come out as transgender. These factors suggest that social contagion may be contributing to the significant rise in the number of young people seeking treatment for gender dysphoria.Current psychotherapeutic practice involves immediate affirmation of a young person's self-diagnosis, which often leads to support for social and even medical transition. Although this practice will likely help small numbers of children, there may also be many false positives.},

With the aim of systematically reviewing the available literature in this field, this study identifies 31 papers that explore the rates of NSSI and suicidality in trans people. From reviewing the literature, it was revealed that trans people have a higher prevalence of NSSI and suicidality compared to the cisgender (non-trans) population. There appear to be some gender differences within these rates, with trans men at a greater risk for NSSI behaviour. Prevalence rates differ depending on the different stages of transition, but they are still overall greater than the cisgender population. The study concludes that trans individuals are at a greater risk of NSSI behaviour and suicidality than the cisgender population, and discusses risk factors and the need to develop effective preventative interventions.},

  abstract = {Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) have revolutionized the field of genome engineering. We present here a systematic assessment of TALE DNA recognition, using quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reporter gene activation assays. Within TALE proteins, tandem 34-amino acid repeats recognize one base pair each and direct sequence-specific DNA binding through repeat variable di-residues (RVDs). We found that RVD choice can affect affinity by four orders of magnitude, with the relative RVD contribution in the order NG {$>$} HD {$\sim$} NN {$\gg$} NI {$>$} NK. The NN repeat preferred the base G over A, whereas the NK repeat bound G with 10(3)-fold lower affinity. We compared AvrBs3, a naturally occurring TALE that recognizes its target using some atypical RVD-base combinations, with a designed TALE that precisely matches `standard' RVDs with the target bases. This comparison revealed unexpected differences in sensitivity to substitutions of the invariant 5{${'}$}-T. Another surprising observation was that base mismatches at the 5{${'}$} end of the target site had more disruptive effects on affinity than those at the 3{${'}$} end, particularly in designed TALEs. These results provide evidence that TALE\textendash DNA recognition exhibits a hitherto un-described polarity effect, in which the N-terminal repeats contribute more to affinity than C-terminal ones.},

The difficulties, as we see them, stem from two main sources: (1) though a general ``trans'' sensibility exists in both the United States and worldwide, there are currently few measurable and/or standardized criteria (e.g. physical, social, political, etc.) regarding what might or should constitute a transgender person; and (2) problems with locating and accounting for this population are compounded by the relative invisibility through which many transgender individuals exist in their daily lives. Marginalized by political, religious, legal, medical, and other cultural institutions, transgender persons encounter levels of discrimination that range from simple misapprehension and/or exclusion by an uneducated public, to explicit acts of sexual and physical violence. Indeed, many in what is often referred to as the mainstream, including transgender individuals, are first exposed to the idea of ``transgender'' through media that often sensationalize and misrepresent the issues most salient for this population.},

  abstract = {Throughout their lifetime, cells are subject to extrinsic and intrinsic mutational processes leaving behind characteristic signatures in the genome. DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency leads to hypermutation and is found in different cancer types. Although it is possible to associate mutational signatures extracted from human cancers with possible mutational processes, the exact causation is often unknown. Here, we use C. elegans genome sequencing of pms-2 and mlh-1 knockouts to reveal the mutational patterns linked to C. elegans MMR deficiency and their dependency on endogenous replication errors and errors caused by deletion of the polymerase {$\epsilon$} subunit pole-4. Signature extraction from 215 human colorectal and 289 gastric adenocarcinomas revealed three MMR-associated signatures, one of which closely resembles the C. elegans MMR spectrum and strongly discriminates microsatellite stable and unstable tumors (AUC = 98\%). A characteristic difference between human and C. elegans MMR deficiency is the lack of elevated levels of NCG {$>$} NTG mutations in C. elegans, likely caused by the absence of cytosine (CpG) methylation in worms. The other two human MMR signatures may reflect the interaction between MMR deficiency and other mutagenic processes, but their exact cause remains unknown. In summary, combining information from genetically defined models and cancer samples allows for better aligning mutational signatures to causal mutagenic processes.},

The importance of a person-centred approach in undertaking a holistic assessment is highlighted. A brief overview of the relational aspects of person-centred care (PCC) is provided and it is suggested that four key dimensions of PCC should be considered as important factors in holistic assessment: connection, caring attitude, communication and control.},

  abstract = {Introduction During the last decade, the age of youths presenting for gender confirmation has steadily fallen. Transgender adolescents are being treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues and subsequently cross-sex hormones at early or midpuberty, with genital surgery as the presumed final step in treatment for female-affirmed (male-to-female) individuals. Despite the minimum age of 18 as eligibility to undergo irreversible procedures, anecdotal reports show that vaginoplasties of female-affirmed patients under 18 have been performed by surgeons, thereby contravening the World Professional Association for Transgender Health Standards of Care. Aim The purpose of this article is (i) to provide a review of salient factors regarding genital surgery in transgender adolescents; (ii) to review various ethical protocols for determining maturity in gender dysphoric individuals under 18; and (iii) to present a new systematic set of ethical principles largely derived from the surgical management of youths with disorders of sex development and adapted to the needs of transitioning adolescents. Methods A literature review of the topic was performed. Ethical guidelines derived from applied treatment protocols of children with disorders of sex development were written. Main Outcome Measure Progressing from the current state of ethical standards and clinical assumptions, a new development of ethical guidelines for genital surgery in the female-affirmed transgender adolescent was created. Results There were no controlled studies of vaginoplasties performed on female-affirmed adolescents under 18 years of age. A new set of ethical guidelines was created in order to support treatment professionals in their decision making process. Conclusions Professionals across disciplines treating female-affirmed adolescents can utilize the proposed ethical guidelines to facilitate decision making on a case-by-case basis in order to protect both patients and practitioners. These guidelines may also be used in support of more open discussions and disclosures of surgical results that could further the advancement of treatment in this emerging population. Milrod C.

  abstract = {Introduction Rising numbers of trans women are undergoing genital surgeries, such as vulvoplasty or vulvovaginoplasty, to create a neovagina. Medical professionals who adhere to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care, Version 7, and who recommend or perform these procedures, are expected to balance best practices with patient preferences, specifically the decision to create or omit the vaginal canal. Due to a paucity of literature on gender-confirming vulvoplasty (GCV) in trans women, there has been no documentation of factors that prompt practitioners to reject or recommend the procedure. Aim The aim of the study was to provide descriptive data of WPATH-affiliated medical professionals' knowledge, experiences, and attitudes toward GCV; surgical risks, benefits, and any considerations when referring transgender women 18\textendash 21 years of age for this procedure. Methods Purposive sampling of all physicians, surgeons, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and registered nurses listed in the WPATH membership directory was initiated via invitational e-mails. The 32-item survey focused on demographics, medical practices, surgical techniques, and reasons for recommending or rejecting the procedure. Data analysis included frequencies and Pearson's {$\chi$}2 test. Main Outcome Measures Key outcome measures included frequency of cases performed; reasons for recommending, rejecting, or performing GCV; and differences in attitudes toward the procedure among various medical professionals. Results N~= 198 (20.7\%) of 956 solicited professionals completed the survey. Surgeons (n~= 61) comprised 30.8\% of the total sample. 46 surgeons (76.7\%) reported having performed vulvovaginoplasty, and 25 (41.7\%) had performed GCV. ``Patient request'' was the most common reason for recommending or performing GCV. Surgeons were more likely to either agree and perform (30.4\%), or reject (32.1\%) GCV in a patient aged 18\textendash 21 than other practitioners, who were more likely to be ``unsure'' (68.5\%). These differences were statistically significant ({$\chi$}2~= 16.467 [2]; n~= 193; P {$<$} .001). Clinical Implications The data identify a lack of standardized terminology and surgical techniques concerning GCV. Strength \& Limitations This is the first exploratory study to assess medical practitioner experiences and attitudes toward a seldom documented procedure. A larger, more inclusive sample would increase the statistical strength and representative aspect of the study. Conclusion The study shows divergence in attitudes and knowledge among medical practitioners who recommend or perform GCV, and uncertainty when the patient is 18\textendash 21 years old. The study contributes to an expanded description and specific indications of performing GCV in the updated WPATH SOC Version~8. Milrod C, Monto M, Karasic DH.

  abstract = {Introduction: Tumor genomes can be reconstructed from the molecular information obtained from circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) obtained from the peripheral blood of patients with cancer. The analysis of cfDNA and CTCs is a minimally invasive approach and represents a powerful research tool, with potential as a companion diagnostic for both patient stratification and monitoring. Here, we use cfDNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis to assess and compare ctDNA profiles in patients with SCLC. Methods: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) libraries were prepared from cfDNA isolated from the pre-treatment peripheral blood samples from 69 patients and 32 cancer-free controls. Libraries were subjected to WGS to establish genome wide copy number aberrations (CNA) as well as targeted mutation analysis of 110 SCLC associated genes. Quantitative metrics were calculated from CNA such as Percent Genome Altered (PGA; percentage of genomic regions altered), Z-score (measure of standard deviation) and Moran's I (measure of spatial autocorrelation). In addition CellSearch\textregistered, an epitope dependent enrichment platform was used to enumerate CTCs from a parallel blood sample. Results: An examination of CNA patterns revealed SCLC associated changes such as losses on chromosomes 3p, 5q and 17p and gains on chromosome 3q and 5p as well as amplification of MYC in 21/69 (30\%) and SOX2 in 36/69 (52\%) as well losses on FHIT in 40/69 (58\%), RASSFI in 38/69(55\%) and RB1 in 24/69 (35\%) patients. A combination of three CNA metrics enabled detection of tumor associated changes in 58/64 (84\%) patients, with Moran's I emerging as the most sensitive CNA metric for detecting ctDNA. Targeted NGS detected tumor associated mutations in 60/64 (94\%) with TP53 mutations detected in 50 patients (83\% of patients with any detectable ctDNA). Somatic mutations and CNA were detected in both limited stage SCLC (LS-SCLC, confined to 1 hemithorax) and extensive stage (ES-SCLC, with distant metastases) with statistically significant differences seen for CNA metrics and variant allele frequencies of mutations consistent with higher levels of ctDNA in ES-SCLC. However, no significant differences between ES and LS were observed in the mutation patterns with respect to DNA damage repair, RAS and PI3K and transcriptional regulation pathways between the two stages of SCLC. There was considerable overlap between the detection of ctDNA and CTC counts, with cfDNA NGS readouts detecting tumor related changes in 96\% of patients and CTCs were detected only in 76\% of patients. Conclusion: We have established sensitive methods for detecting ctDNA in cfDNA and combined with CTC enumeration we have an effective liquid biopsy for 98\% of patients (96\% in LS and 100\% in ES) in this cohort. Future work will involve utilising this optimised NGS approach in an independent cohort of patients to correlate cfDNA metrics with clinical outcome.

  abstract = {Introduction SCLC accounts for approximately 250,000 deaths worldwide each year. Acquisition of adequate tumor biopsy samples is challenging, and liquid biopsies present an alternative option for patient stratification and response monitoring. Methods We applied whole genome next-generation sequencing to circulating free DNA (cfDNA) from 39 patients with limited-stage (LS) SCLC and 30 patients with extensive-stage SCLC to establish genome-wide copy number aberrations and also performed targeted mutation analysis of 110 SCLC associated genes. Quantitative metrics were calculated for copy number aberrations, including percent genome amplified (PGA [the percentage of genomic regions amplified]), Z-score (a measure of standard deviation), and Moran's I (a measure of spatial autocorrelation). In addition CellSearch, an epitope-dependent enrichment platform, was used to enumerate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a parallel blood sample. Results Genome-wide and targeted cfDNA sequencing data identified tumor-related changes in 94\% of patients with LS SCLC and 100\% of patients with extensive-stage SCLC. Parallel analysis of CTCs based on at least 1 CTC/7.5 mL of blood increased tumor detection frequencies to 95\% for LS SCLC. Both CTC counts and cfDNA readouts correlated with disease stage and overall survival. Conclusions We demonstrate that a simple cfDNA genome-wide copy number approach provides an effective means of monitoring patients through treatment and show that targeted cfDNA sequencing identifies potential therapeutic targets in more than 50\% of patients. We are now incorporating this approach into additional studies and trials of targeted therapies.},

  abstract = {Sizing up circulating tumor DNA Unlike solid tumors, which are often hidden deep within a patient's body, a patient's blood is easy to access safely. As a result, liquid biopsy, the analysis of tumor DNA in the blood, is an attractive alternative to conventional biopsy. Unfortunately, tumor DNA molecules are usually vastly outnumbered by the fragments of noncancer DNA in the blood, and detecting them can be a challenge, especially in early stages of cancer. Mouliere et al. identified characteristic differences in the size distribution of tumor-derived and noncancer DNA fragments and then used these observations to design a method of tumor DNA detection with greater sensitivity. Existing methods to improve detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have focused on genomic alterations but have rarely considered the biological properties of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA). We hypothesized that differences in fragment lengths of circulating DNA could be exploited to enhance sensitivity for detecting the presence of ctDNA and for noninvasive genomic analysis of cancer. We surveyed ctDNA fragment sizes in 344 plasma samples from 200 patients with cancer using low-pass whole-genome sequencing (0.4\texttimes ). To establish the size distribution of mutant ctDNA, tumor-guided personalized deep sequencing was performed in 19 patients. We detected enrichment of ctDNA in fragment sizes between 90 and 150 bp and developed methods for in vitro and in silico size selection of these fragments. Selecting fragments between 90 and 150 bp improved detection of tumor DNA, with more than twofold median enrichment in {$>$}95\% of cases and more than fourfold enrichment in {$>$}10\% of cases. Analysis of size-selected cfDNA identified clinically actionable mutations and copy number alterations that were otherwise not detected. Identification of plasma samples from patients with advanced cancer was improved by predictive models integrating fragment length and copy number analysis of cfDNA, with area under the curve (AUC) {$>$}0.99 compared to AUC {$<$}0.80 without fragmentation features. Increased identification of cfDNA from patients with glioma, renal, and pancreatic cancer was achieved with AUC {$>$} 0.91 compared to AUC {$<$} 0.5 without fragmentation features. Fragment size analysis and selective sequencing of specific fragment sizes can boost ctDNA detection and could complement or provide an alternative to deeper sequencing of cfDNA. Selective sequencing or in silico analysis for differences in DNA fragment size can improve the detection of circulating tumor DNA. Selective sequencing or in silico analysis for differences in DNA fragment size can improve the detection of circulating tumor DNA.},

Here we show that ultraviolet irradiation (UV) affects cotranscriptional AS in a p53-independent way, through the hyperphosphorylation of RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) and~a subsequent inhibition of transcriptional elongation, estimated in~vivo and in real time. Phosphomimetic CTD mutants not only display lower elongation but also duplicate the UV effect on AS. Consistently, nonphosphorylatable mutants prevent the UV effect. Apoptosis promoted by UV in cells lacking p53 is prevented when the change in AS of the apoptotic gene bcl-x is reverted, confirming the relevance of this mechanism. Splicing-sensitive microarrays revealed a significant overlap of the subsets of genes that have changed AS with UV and those that have reduced expression, suggesting that transcriptional coupling to AS is a key feature of the DNA-damage response.},

These control ratio mixtures with defined abundance ratios enable assessment of diagnostic performance of differentially expressed transcript lists, limit of detection of ratio (LODR) estimates and expression ratio variability and measurement bias. The performance metrics suite is applicable to analysis of a typical experiment, and here we also apply these metrics to evaluate technical performance among laboratories. An interlaboratory study using identical samples shared among 12 laboratories with three different measurement processes demonstrates generally consistent diagnostic power across 11 laboratories. Ratio measurement variability and bias are also comparable among laboratories for the same measurement process. We observe different biases for measurement processes using different mRNA-enrichment protocols.},

  abstract = {Aims: If an individual receives a diagnosis, this can identify them as a member of a stigmatised group. The aim of this paper is to review the relevant literature in order to address three main questions about group identification. 1) When an individual is identified by others as being a member of a stigmatised group, do they tend to identify themselves as a member of that group? 2) What is the relationship between identification with a stigmatised group and self-evaluation? 3) Is this relationship different for mental health and learning disabilities diagnoses? Method: The academic literature was searched using PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, Medline and Google Scholar to identify peer-reviewed articles that explore the relationship between group identification, self-stigma and self-evaluation in the two diagnosed groups: mental health problems and learning disabilities. Results: Sixty-eight studies were identified by systematic search, 13 met criteria for this review. Eight papers focused on mental health and five focused on learning disabilities. Conclusions: There was variation in quality of methodology used, so conclusions are tentative. People tended to identify with their group but variation in level of group identification was found. Identification with the mental health problems group seemed to impact negatively on self-evaluation when the group had little value to the group member and group membership did not aid coping with stigma; if the group was valued and coping resources increased, self-evaluation could be protected. Ingroup, downward comparison to protect self-evaluation was present in both groups, but was more of a focus in the learning disabilities literature; there were no reports of the learning disabilities group being valued by its members. Implications for future research are discussed, including the study of other diagnoses such as Autism Spectrum Condition.},

  abstract = {Background: It has been widely suggested that over 80\% of transgender children will come to identify as cisgender (i.e., desist) as they mature, with the assumption that for this 80\%, the trans identity was a temporary ``phase.'' This statistic is used as the scientific rationale for discouraging social transition for pre-pubertal children. This article is a critical commentary on the limitations of this research and a caution against using these studies to develop care recommendations for gender-nonconforming children.Methods: A critical review methodology is employed to systematically interpret four frequently-cited studies that sought to document identity outcomes for gender-nonconforming children (often referred to as ``desistance'' research).Results: Methodological, theoretical, ethical, and interpretive concerns regarding four ``desistance'' studies are presented. The authors clarify the historical and clinical contexts within which these studies were conducted to deconstruct assumptions in interpretations of the results. The discussion makes distinctions between the specific evidence provided by these studies versus the assumptions that have shaped recommendations for care. The affirmative model is presented as a way to move away from the question of, ``How should children's gender identities develop over time?'' toward a more useful question: ``How should children best be supported as their gender identity develops?''Conclusion: The tethering of childhood gender diversity to the framework of ``desistance'' or ``persistence'' has stifled advancements in our understanding of children's gender in all its complexity. These follow-up studies fall short in helping us understand what children need. As work begins on the 8th version of the Standards of Care by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, we call for a more inclusive conceptual framework that takes children's voices seriously. Listening to children's experiences will enable a more comprehensive understanding of the needs of gender-nonconforming children and provide guidance to scientific and lay communities.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in single-cell genomics provide an alternative to gene-centric metagenomics studies, enabling whole genome sequencing of uncultivated bacteria. However, single-cell assembly projects are challenging due to (i) the highly non-uniform read coverage, and (ii) a greatly elevated number of chimeric reads and read pairs. While recently developed single-cell assemblers have addressed the former challenge, methods for assembling highly chimeric reads remain poorly explored. We present algorithms for identifying chimeric edges and resolving complex bulges in de Bruijn graphs, which significantly improve single-cell assemblies. We further describe applications of the single-cell assembler SPAdes to a new approach for capturing and sequencing ``dark matter of life'' that forms small pools of randomly selected single cells (called a mini-metagenome) and further sequences all genomes from the mini-metagenome at once. We demonstrate that SPAdes enables sequencing mini-metagenomes and benchmark it against various assemblers. On single-cell bacterial datasets, SPAdes improves on the recently developed E+V-SC and IDBA-UD assemblers specifically designed for single-cell sequencing. For standard (multicell) datasets, SPAdes also improves on A5, ABySS, CLC, EULER-SR, Ray, SOAPdenovo, and Velvet.},

Addressing stigma is fundamental to delivering quality healthcare and achieving optimal health. This correspondence article seeks to assess how developments over the past 5\,years have contributed to the state of programmatic knowledge\textemdash both approaches and methods\textemdash regarding interventions to reduce stigma in health facilities, and explores the potential to concurrently address multiple health condition stigmas. It is supported by findings from a systematic review of published articles indexed in PubMed, Psychinfo and Web of Science, and in the United States Agency for International Development's Development Experience Clearinghouse, which was conducted in February 2018 and restricted to the past 5\,years. Forty-two studies met inclusion criteria and provided insight on interventions to reduce HIV, mental illness, or substance abuse stigma. Multiple common approaches to address stigma in health facilities emerged, which were implemented in a variety of ways. The literature search identified key gaps including a dearth of stigma reduction interventions in health facilities that focus on tuberculosis, diabetes, leprosy, or cancer; target multiple cadres of staff or multiple ecological levels; leverage interactive technology; or address stigma experienced by health workers. Preliminary results from ongoing innovative responses to these gaps are also described.},

About half (50.5\%) of the youth were assigned a male sex at birth. Baseline physiologic values were within normal ranges for assigned sex at birth. Youth recognized gender incongruence at a mean age of 8.3 years (standard deviation = 4.5), yet disclosed to their family much later (mean = 17.1; standard deviation = 4.2). Gender dysphoria was high among all participants. Thirty-five percent of the participants reported depression symptoms in the clinical range. More than half of the youth reported having thought about suicide at least once in their lifetime, and nearly a third had made at least one attempt.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusions{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Baseline physiologic parameters were within normal ranges for assigned sex at birth. Transgender youth are aware of the incongruence between their internal gender identity and their assigned sex at early ages. Prevalence of depression and suicidality demonstrates that youth may benefit from timely and appropriate intervention. Evaluation of these youth over time will help determine the impact of medical intervention and mental health therapy.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {AIMS: Electronic healthcare records (EHRs) are increasingly used to store clinical information. A secondary benefit of EHRs is their use, in an anonymized form, for observational research. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) contains EHRs from primary care in the UK and, despite 1083 peer-reviewed research publications, has never been used to obtain pharmacogenetic samples. Using a statin-induced myopathy paradigm, we evaluated using the CPRD to obtain patient samples for a pharmacogenetic study targeting 250 cases and 500 controls from UK general practitioner (GP) practices. METHODS: The CPRD identified potential patients fitting specific case-definition criteria (active rhabdomyolysis or creatine phosphokinase {$>$} four times the upper limit of normal), and corresponding GP practices were asked to invite patient participation. Consenting patients were requested to provide either saliva or blood samples and to complete an ethnicity questionnaire. Control subjects were recruited from the same GP practice (saliva) or a small number of practices (blood). Samples were forwarded for DNA extraction. RESULTS: Thirty-six months of recruitment yielded DNA samples from 149 statin-induced myopathy cases and 587 tolerant controls. Data show that contacting patients through their GP is a reliable method for obtaining samples without compromising anonymity. Saliva collection directly from patients was considerably less effective than blood sampling. After 10 months of recruitment, saliva sampling was suspended in favour of blood sampling. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the potential of EHRs for identifying accurately phenotyped cases and controls for pharmacogenetic studies. Recruitment was successful only because of the willingness of GP practices to participate and the existence of strong doctor-patient relationships. The present study provides a model that can be implemented in future genetic analyses using EHRs.},

  abstract = {Objective Suicide is a major public health concern as each year 30,000 people die by suicide in the US alone. In the teenage population, it is the second leading cause of death. There have been extensive studies of psychosocial factors associated with suicide and suicidal behavior. However, very little is known about the neurobiology of suicide. Recent research has provided some understanding of the neurobiology of suicide, which is the topic of this review. Methods Neurobiology of suicide has been studied using peripheral tissues, such as platelets, lymphocytes, and cerebral spinal fluid obtained from suicidal patients or from the postmortem brains of suicide victims. Results These studies have provided encouraging information with regard to the neurobiology of suicide. They show an abnormality of serotonergic mechanism, such as increased serotonin receptor subtypes and decreased serotonin metabolites, such as 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. These studies also suggest abnormalities of receptor-linked signaling mechanisms, such as phosphoinositide and adenylyl cyclase signaling mechanisms. Other biological systems that appear to be dysregulated in suicide are the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and abnormalities of neurotrophins and neurotrophin receptors. More recently, several studies also indicate abnormalities of neuroimmune functions in suicide. Conclusions These studies have been discussed in detail in the following review. Some encouraging information has emerged, primarily related to some of these neurobiological mechanisms. It is hoped that neurobiological studies may eventually result in identifying appropriate biomarkers for suicidal behavior as well as appropriate therapeutic targets for its treatment.},

Accurate computational methods for the quantification of transcript abundances are essential for downstream analysis. However, most existing approaches are much slower than is necessary for their degree of accuracy. We introduce Salmon, a novel method and software tool for transcript quantification that exhibits state-of-the-art accuracy while being significantly faster than most other tools. Salmon achieves this through the combined application of a two-phase inference procedure, a reduced data representation, and a novel lightweight read alignment algorithm. Salmon is written in C++11, and is available under the GPL v3 license as open-source software at https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon.},

  abstract = {Background: Multimorbidity, the presence of more than 1 long-term disorder, is associated with increased use of health services, but unplanned admissions to hospital may often be undesirable. Furthermore, socioeconomic deprivation and mental health comorbidity may lead to additional unplanned admissions. We examined the association between unplanned admission to hospital and physical multimorbidity, mental health and socioeconomic deprivation. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 180 815 patients aged 20 years and older who were registered with 40 general practices in Scotland. Details of 32 physical and 8 mental health morbidities were extracted from the patients' electronic health records (as of Apr. 1, 2006) and linked to hospital admission data. We then recorded the occurrence of unplanned or potentially preventable unplanned acute (nonpsychiatric) admissions to hospital in the subsequent 12 months. We used logistic regression models, adjusting for age and sex, to determine associations between unplanned or potentially preventable unplanned admissions to hospital and physical multimorbidity, mental health and socioeconomic deprivation. Results: We identified 10 828 (6.0\%) patients who had at least 1 unplanned admission to hospital and 2037 (1.1\%) patients who had at least 1 potentially preventable unplanned admission to hospital. Both unplanned and potentially preventable unplanned admissions were independently associated with increasing physical multimorbidity (for {$\geq$} 4 v. 0 conditions, odds ratio [OR] 5.87 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 5.45\textendash 6.32] for unplanned admissions, OR 14.38 [95\% CI 11.87\textendash 17.43] for potentially preventable unplanned admissions), mental health conditions (for {$\geq$} 1 v. 0 conditions, OR 2.01 [95\% CI 1.92\textendash 2.09] for unplanned admissions, OR 1.80 [95\% CI 1.64\textendash 1.97] for potentially preventable unplanned admissions) and socioeconomic deprivation (for most v. least deprived quintile, OR 1.56 [95\% CI 1.43\textendash 1.70] for unplanned admissions, OR 1.98 [95\% CI 1.63\textendash 2.41] for potentially preventable unplanned admissions). Interpretation: Physical multimorbidity was strongly associated with unplanned admission to hospital, including admissions that were potentially preventable. The risk of admission to hospital was exacerbated by the coexistence of mental health conditions and socioeconomic deprivation.},

  abstract = {Polypharmacy is a common issue in clinical practice, with 20\% of adults given {$\geq$}5 regular medications. It particularly impacts elderly individuals and those with multiple morbidities, and is worsened by single-disease, guideline-driven prescribing and service pressures. Although sometimes appropriate, it can also be problematic, associated with a range of adverse outcomes including hazardous prescribing, excess treatment burden, poor quality of life, higher health service use, and increased morbidity and mortality. Polypharmacy management is complex because of the presence of multiple problems, competing priorities and clinical uncertainty. The mainstay of management is currently medication review, which should be holistic and patient centred, and employ shared decision-making. Key elements include addressing unnecessary prescribing, ineffective prescribing, drug safety and cost-effectiveness. Deprescribing is a core means of reducing polypharmacy, although there are several important barriers to its delivery, including a weak evidence base. In the longer term, preventing inappropriate polypharmacy requires a significant shift in prescribing culture, and is likely to take considerable time to achieve.},

A bibliographic search was conducted across electronic databases between 1995 and 2015. The search identified 45 experiments from 38 articles and 17 unique proposed mediators that were categorized into affective/subjective (n = 6), cognitive (n = 7) and motivational mechanisms (n = 4). Empirical support was accrued for mediators such as anxiety, negative thinking, and mind-wandering, which are suggested to co-opt working memory resources under stereotype threat. Other research points to the assertion that stereotype threatened individuals may be motivated to disconfirm negative stereotypes, which can have a paradoxical effect of hampering performance. However, stereotype threat appears to affect diverse social groups in different ways, with no one mediator providing unequivocal empirical support. Underpinned by the multi-threat framework, the discussion postulates that different forms of stereotype threat may be mediated by distinct mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Noncoding sequence contains pathogenic mutations. Yet, compared with mutations in protein-coding sequence, pathogenic regulatory mutations are notoriously difficult to recognize. Most fundamentally, we are not yet adept at recognizing the sequence stretches in the human genome that are most important in regulating  the expression of genes. For this reason, it is difficult to apply to the regulatory regions the same kinds of analytical paradigms that are being successfully applied to identify mutations among protein-coding regions that influence risk. To determine whether dosage sensitive genes have distinct patterns among their noncoding sequence, we present two primary approaches that focus solely on a gene's proximal noncoding regulatory sequence. The first approach is a regulatory sequence analogue of the recently introduced residual variation intolerance score (RVIS), termed noncoding RVIS, or ncRVIS. The ncRVIS  compares observed and predicted levels of standing variation in the regulatory sequence of human genes. The second approach, termed ncGERP, reflects the phylogenetic conservation of a gene's regulatory sequence using GERP++. We assess how well these two approaches correlate with four gene lists that use different ways to identify genes known or likely to cause disease through changes in expression: 1) genes that are known to cause disease through haploinsufficiency,  2) genes curated as dosage sensitive in ClinGen's Genome Dosage Map, 3) genes judged likely to be under purifying selection for mutations that change expression levels because they are statistically depleted of loss-of-function variants in the general population, and 4) genes judged unlikely to cause disease based on the presence of copy number variants in the general population. We find  that both noncoding scores are highly predictive of dosage sensitivity using any  of these criteria. In a similar way to ncGERP, we assess two ensemble-based predictors of regional noncoding importance, ncCADD and ncGWAVA, and find both scores are significantly predictive of human dosage sensitive genes and appear to carry information beyond conservation, as assessed by ncGERP. These results highlight that the intolerance of noncoding sequence stretches in the human genome can provide a critical complementary tool to other genome annotation approaches to help identify the parts of the human genome increasingly likely to  harbor mutations that influence risk of disease.},

  abstract = {The use of machine learning to guide clinical decision making has the potential to worsen existing health disparities. Several recent works frame the problem as that of algorithmic fairness, a framework that has attracted considerable attention and criticism. However, the appropriateness of this framework is unclear due to both ethical as well as technical considerations, the latter of which include trade-offs between measures of fairness and model performance that are not well-understood for predictive models of clinical outcomes. To inform the ongoing debate, we conduct an empirical study to characterize the impact of penalizing group fairness violations on an array of measures of model performance and group fairness. We repeat the analyses across multiple observational healthcare databases, clinical outcomes, and sensitive attributes. We find that procedures that penalize differences between the distributions of predictions across groups induce nearly-universal degradation of multiple performance metrics within groups. On examining the secondary impact of these procedures, we observe heterogeneity of the effect of these procedures on measures of fairness in calibration and ranking across experimental conditions. Beyond the reported trade-offs, we emphasize that analyses of algorithmic fairness in healthcare lack the contextual grounding and causal awareness necessary to reason about the mechanisms that lead to health disparities, as well as about the potential of algorithmic fairness methods to counteract those mechanisms. In light of these limitations, we encourage researchers building predictive models for clinical use to step outside the algorithmic fairness frame and engage critically with the broader sociotechnical context surrounding the use of machine learning in healthcare.},

  abstract = {Predictive modeling with electronic health record (EHR) data is anticipated to drive personalized medicine and improve healthcare quality. Constructing predictive statistical models typically requires extraction of curated predictor variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive process that discards the vast majority of information in each patient's record. We propose a representation of patients' entire, raw EHR records based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that deep learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately predicting multiple medical events from multiple centers without site-specific data harmonization. We validated our approach using de-identified EHR data from two U.S. academic medical centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at least 24 hours. In the sequential format we propose, this volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical notes. Deep learning models achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting in-hospital mortality (AUROC across sites 0.93-0.94), 30-day unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75-0.76), prolonged length of stay (AUROC 0.85-0.86), and all of a patient's final discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These models outperformed state-of-the-art traditional predictive models in all cases. We also present a case-study of a neural-network attribution system, which illustrates how clinicians can gain some transparency into the predictions. We believe that this approach can be used to create accurate and scalable predictions for a variety of clinical scenarios, complete with explanations that directly highlight evidence in the patient's chart.},

  abstract = {Central to the development of cancer are genetic changes that endow these ``cancer cells'' with many of the hallmarks of cancer, such as self-sufficient growth and resistance to anti-growth and pro-death signals. However, while the genetic changes that occur within cancer cells themselves, such as activated oncogenes or dysfunctional tumor suppressors, are responsible for many aspects of cancer development, they are not sufficient. Tumor promotion and progression are dependent on ancillary processes provided by cells of the tumor environment but that are not necessarily cancerous themselves. Inflammation has long been associated with the development of cancer. This review will discuss the reflexive relationship between cancer and inflammation with particular focus on how considering the role of inflammation in physiologic processes such as the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and repair may provide a logical framework for understanding the connection between the inflammatory response and cancer.},

At least two distinct pathways are currently known to be engaged by TLR4 and are distinguished by their dependence on the adaptor molecule MyD88. We have used gene expression microarrays to define the effects of each of three variables\textemdash LPS dose, LPS versus IFN-{$\beta$} and -{$\gamma$}, and genetic background\textemdash on the transcriptional response of mouse BMDMs. Analysis of correlation networks generated from the data has identified subnetworks or modules within the macrophage transcriptional network that are activated selectively by these variables. We have identified mouse strain-specific signatures, including a module enriched for SLE susceptibility candidates. In the modules of genes unique to different treatments, we found a module of genes induced by type-I IFN but not by LPS treatment, suggesting another layer of complexity in the LPS-TLR4 signaling feedback control. We also observe that the activation of the complement system, in common with the known activation of MHC class 2 genes, is reliant on IFN-{$\gamma$} signaling. Taken together, these data further highlight the exquisite nature of the regulatory systems that control macrophage activation, their likely relevance to disease resistance/susceptibility, and the appropriate response of these cells to proinflammatory stimuli.},

Recent studies indicate that mammalian Notch receptors are expressed by postmitotic neurons and that Notch signaling has a considerable influence on dendritic growth and branching. Investigations into the intracellular effectors of dendritic development have revealed that dendritic growth and branching are differentially  affected by activation of the Rho-family GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. These observations suggest that the differential activation of Notch receptors and Rho-family GTPases by extracellular signals may be important in the generation of morphological diversity in the developing nervous system.},

Methods From 2001\textendash 2002, transgender and non-transgender adults were sampled at a Massachusetts clinic. Health differences were formatively examined by transgender identity using a cross-sectional, clinic-based sample (n=2,653); and a nested matched-pair subsample (n=155). Results Both designs produced virtually identical findings: (1) the prevalence of HIV, substance abuse, and smoking did not differ significantly for transgender and non-transgender patients; (2) transgender patients were more likely to endorse a lifetime suicide attempt and ideation compared to non-transgender patients (p{$<$}0.05); (3) transgender patients disproportionately reported social stressors (violence, discrimination, childhood abuse) relative to non-transgender patients (p{$<$}0.05). Conclusion Findings suggest that a nested design may provide an effective methodology for using clinical data to study transgender health, and underscore the need for routine collection of gender identity in clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Metastatic melanoma is the most deadly type of skin cancer. Despite the success of immunotherapy and targeted agents, the majority of patients experience disease recurrence upon treatment and die due to their disease. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a new subclass of non-protein coding RNAs involved in (epigenetic) regulation of cell growth, invasion, and other important cellular functions. Consequently, recent research activities focused on the discovery of these lncRNAs in a broad spectrum of human diseases, especially cancer. Additional efforts have been undertaken to dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms employed by lncRNAs. In this review, we will summarize the growing evidence of deregulated lncRNA expression in melanoma, which is linked to tumor growth and progression. Moreover, we will highlight specific molecular pathways and modes of action for some well-studied lncRNAs and discuss their potential clinical implications.},

The clinical presentation of children who present with gender identity issues can be highly variable; the psychosexual development and future psychosexual outcome can be unclear, and consensus about the best clinical practice is currently under debate.In this paper a clinical picture is provided of children who are referred to gender identity clinics. The clinical criteria are described including what is known about the prevalence of childhood GD. In addition, an overview is presented of the literature on the psychological functioning of children with GD, the current knowledge on the psychosexual development and factors associated with the persistence of GD, and explanatory models for psychopathology in children with GD together with other co-existing problems that are characteristic for children referred for their gender. In light of this, currently used treatment and counselling approaches are summarized and discussed, including the integration of the literature detailed above.},

  abstract = {The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies of genetic variation and its association with human disease, but epigenomic studies lack a similar reference. To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.},

  abstract = {Objective Childhood gender nonconformity has been associated with increased risk of caregiver abuse and bullying victimization outside the home, but it is unknown whether as a consequence children who are nonconforming are at higher risk of depressive symptoms. Method Using data from a large national cohort (N = 10,655), we examined differences in depressive symptoms from ages 12 through 30 years by gender nonconformity before age 11 years. We examined the prevalence of bullying victimization by gender nonconformity, then ascertained whether increased exposure to abuse and bullying accounted for possible increased risk of depressive symptoms. We further compared results stratified by sexual orientation. Results Participants in the top decile of childhood gender nonconformity were at elevated risk of depressive symptoms at ages 12 through 30 years (for females, 0.19 standard deviations more depressive symptoms than conforming females; for males, 0.34 standard deviations more symptoms than conforming males). By ages 23 to 30 years, 26\% of participants in the top decile of childhood nonconformity had probable mild or moderate depression versus 18\% of participants who were conforming (p {$<$} .001). Abuse and bullying victimization accounted for approximately half the increased prevalence of depressive symptoms in youth who were nonconforming versus conforming. Gender-nonconforming heterosexuals and males were at particularly elevated risk for depressive symptoms. Conclusion Gender nonconformity was a strong predictor of depressive symptoms beginning in adolescence, particularly among males and heterosexuals. Physical and emotional bullying and abuse, both inside and outside the home, accounted for much of this increased risk.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims The prevalence of alcohol-related conditions is often reported as higher in hospital in-patients compared with the general population. However, formal prevalence estimates are commonly derived from small studies which report highly varied results. This systematic review and meta-analysis, within the UK hospital system, aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of the 26 ICD-10 conditions that are wholly attributable to alcohol in in-patient settings. Methods We searched Medline, Embase, PsychINFO and CENTRAL from database inception until 1~May 2018. We included studies of any design that reported the prevalence of one of 26 wholly attributable alcohol conditions defined by the ICD-10. Studies were required to be conducted in one or more of the constituent nations of the United Kingdom and in an in-patient setting (general wards, intensive care units, accident and emergency departments or mental health in-patient units). Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis, and meta-regression tested study and patient factors contributing to variation. Quality was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Results A total of 124 studies were included, reporting on a total of 1\,657\,614 patients. The majority of studies reported on harmful use of alcohol and alcohol dependence, for which the pooled prevalence was 19.76\% [95\% confidence interval (CI)~=~15.61\textendash 24.26\%] and 10.25\% (95\% CI~=~7.06\textendash 13.96\%), respectively. Mean patient age and type of in-patient setting were identified as the main sources of variation in prevalence estimates, but not date of data collection. Both estimates were deemed very low quality according to GRADE. Conclusions An estimated one in five patients in the UK hospital system use alcohol harmfully, and one in 10 are alcohol-dependent.},

Analysis of these large, diverse data sets holds the promise of a more comprehensive understanding of the genome and its relation to human disease. Experienced and knowledgeable human review is an essential component of this process, complementing computational approaches. This calls for efficient and intuitive visualization tools able to scale to very large data sets and to flexibly integrate multiple data types, including clinical data. However, the sheer volume and scope of data pose a significant challenge to the development of such tools. View full text},

The data from each single cell are sparse, comprising on the order of 1,000 unique reads.

  abstract = {In this study, self-organizing map (SOM) gene cluster techniques are applied to the analysis of cDNA microarray analysis of gene expression changes occurring in the early stages of genitourinary inflammation. We determined the time course of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced gene expression in experimental cystitis. Mice were euthanized 0.5, 1, 4, and 24 h after LPS instillation into the urinary bladder, and gene expression was determined using four replicate Atlas mouse cDNA expression arrays containing 588 known genes at each time point. SOM gene cluster analysis, performed without preconditions, identified functionally significant gene clusters based on the kinetics of change in gene expression. Genes were classified as follows: 1) expressed at time 0; 2) early genes (peak expression between 0.5 and 1 h); and 3) late genes (peak expression between 4 and 24 h). One gene cluster maintained a constant level of expression during the entire time period studied. In contrast, LPS treatment downregulated the expression of some genes expressed at time 0, in a cluster including transcription factors, protooncogenes, apoptosis-related proteins (cysteine protease), intracellular kinases, and growth factors. Gene upregulation in response to LPS was observed as early as 0.5 h in a cluster including the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-nerve growth factor ({$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-NGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGF R1), C-C chemokine receptor, and P-selectin. Another tight cluster of genes with marked expression at 1 h after LPS and insignificant expression at all other time points studied included the protooncogenes c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-2, Jun-B, Jun-D, and Egr-1. Almost all interleukin genes were upregulated as early as 1 h after stimulation with LPS. Nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) pathway genes collected in a single cluster with a peak expression 4 h after LPS stimulation. In contrast, most of the interleukin receptors and chemokine receptors presented a late peak of expression 24 h after LPS coinciding with the peak of neutrophil infiltration into the bladder wall. Selected cDNA microarray observations were confirmed by RNase protection assay. In conclusion, the cDNA array experimental approach provided a global profile of gene expression changes in bladder tissue after stimulation with LPS. SOM techniques identified functionally significant gene clusters, providing a powerful technical basis for future analysis of mechanisms of bladder inflammation.},

  abstract = {Background \&amp; Objective   Managing data from large-scale projects (such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)) for further analysis is an important and time consuming step for research projects. Several efforts, such as the Firehose project, make TCGA pre-processed data publicly available via web services and data portals, but this information must be managed, downloaded and prepared for subsequent steps. We have developed an open source and extensible R based data client for pre-processed data from the Firehouse, and demonstrate its use with sample case studies. Results show that our RTCGAToolbox can facilitate data management for researchers interested in working with TCGA data. The RTCGAToolbox can also be integrated with other analysis pipelines for further data processing.

  abstract = {Studies involving the use of probabilistic record linkage are becoming increasingly common. However, the methods underpinning probabilistic record linkage are not widely taught or understood, and therefore these studies can appear to be a `black box' research tool. In this article, we aim to describe the process of probabilistic record linkage through a simple exemplar. We first introduce the concept of deterministic linkage and contrast this with probabilistic linkage. We illustrate each step of the process using a simple exemplar and describe the data structure required to perform a probabilistic linkage. We describe the process of calculating and interpreting matched weights and how to convert matched weights into posterior probabilities of a match using Bayes theorem. We conclude this article with a brief discussion of some of the computational demands of record linkage, how you might assess the quality of your linkage algorithm, and how epidemiologists can maximize the value of their record-linked research using robust record linkage methods.},

  abstract = {The title of a journal paper offers a crucial portal into any scientific field. It determines whether interested readers locate the paper and whether others have enough interest sparked to lead them to read the abstract. This article looks at authored journal paper titles in Medical Education over its first 50~years (n~=~6357) of publication and Medical Teacher over its first 35~years of publication, revealing both trends in areas of interest and how those interests are worded. Word clouds per decade showed a shift from teaching to learning and from examination to assessment, and new foci on learning, patients, research and feedback in both journals. The average length of title in Medical Education peeked in the 2000s, dropping to 70 characters in the 2010s, with no titles being longer than 140 characters (the length of a tweet) in this last decade. Abbreviations were used sparingly. The use of humorous titles, although not common, has increased in recent years. The use of the colon showed a marked increase in the 1980s, dropping a little in the 2000s but resurging in the 2010s. Titles posed as a question increased steadily, appearing to plateau in the 2000s at 11\%. The use of humour and questions suggests that the authors of these articles are submitting papers to be selected by the human rather than just the virtual eye. We also hypothesise that the use of humour may indicate a maturation of medical education as a subject.},

  abstract = {RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, eight of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%\textendash 40\% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {$>$}85\% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {$>$}85\% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same eight tools successfully control their false discovery rate at {$\lessequivlnt$}5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining three tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that more than six biological replicates should be used, rising to more than 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If less than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR the leading tool. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.},

It comprises several subtypes in terms of distinct histopathological features and different clinical presentations. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding transcripts in the genome which vary in expression levels and length and perform diverse functions. They are involved in the inititation, evolution and progression of primary cancer, as well as in the development and spread of metastases. Recently, several lncRNAs were described in RCC. This review emphasises the rising importance of lncRNAs in RCC. Moreover, it provides an outlook on their therapeutic potential in the future.},

In contrast, effectiveness trials, which test treatments across a spectrum of patients in real-world conditions with follow-up periods that match typical treatment regimens, provide critical information on drug effects in those patients who may ultimately receive the treatment. We previously proposed a study design that integrates efficacy and effectiveness trials into a 2-component ``efficacy-to-effectiveness (E2E) trial,'' in which if the initial efficacy trial component is positive, then the trial immediately and seamlessly transitions to the effectiveness trial component., However, we believe that total study duration could be even further shortened by simultaneously addressing efficacy and effectiveness too (EE2). An EE2 trial rigorously demonstrates efficacy, but uses broad inclusion characteristics of effectiveness trials. An example of a study using EE2 design, the IMMEDIATE (Immediate Myocardial Metabolic enhancement During Initial Assessment and Treatment in Emergency Care) trial, is provided.},

  abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is an important mechanism of eukaryotic gene regulation. Deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become a powerful approach for quantitative profiling of AS. With the increasing capacity of high-throughput sequencers, it has become common for RNA-Seq studies of AS to examine multiple biological replicates. We developed rMATS, a new statistical method for robust and flexible detection of differential AS from replicate RNA-Seq data. Besides the analysis of unpaired replicates, rMATS includes a model specifically designed for paired replicates, such as case\textendash control matched pairs in clinical RNA-Seq datasets. We expect rMATS will be useful for genome-wide studies of AS in diverse research projects. Our data also provide new insights about the experimental design for RNA-Seq studies of AS., Ultra-deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become a powerful approach for genome-wide analysis of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. We previously developed multivariate analysis of transcript splicing (MATS), a statistical method for detecting differential alternative splicing between two RNA-Seq samples. Here we describe a new statistical model and computer program, replicate MATS (rMATS), designed for detection of differential alternative splicing from replicate RNA-Seq data. rMATS uses a hierarchical model to simultaneously account for sampling uncertainty in individual replicates and variability among replicates. In addition to the analysis of unpaired replicates, rMATS also includes a model specifically designed for paired replicates between sample groups. The hypothesis-testing framework of rMATS is flexible and can assess the statistical significance over any user-defined magnitude of splicing change. The performance of rMATS is evaluated by the analysis of simulated and real RNA-Seq data. rMATS outperformed two existing methods for replicate RNA-Seq data in all simulation settings, and RT-PCR yielded a high validation rate (94\%) in an RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines. Our data also provide guiding principles for designing RNA-Seq studies of alternative splicing. We demonstrate that it is essential to incorporate biological replicates in the study design. Of note, pooling RNAs or merging RNA-Seq data from multiple replicates is not an effective approach to account for variability, and the result is particularly sensitive to outliers. The rMATS source code is freely available at rnaseq-mats.sourceforge.net/. As the popularity of RNA-Seq continues to grow, we expect rMATS will be useful for studies of alternative splicing in diverse RNA-Seq projects.},

  abstract = {Background: There is a lack of long-term register-based follow-up studies of sex-reassigned individuals concerning mortality and psychiatric morbidity. Accordingly, the present study investigated both mortality and psychiatric morbidity using a sample of individuals with transsexualism which comprised 98\% (n = 104) of all individuals in Denmark. Aims: (1) To investigate psychiatric morbidity before and after sex reassignment surgery (SRS) among Danish individuals who underwent SRS during the period of 1978\textendash 2010. (2) To investigate mortality among Danish individuals who underwent SRS during the period of 1978\textendash 2010. Method: Psychiatric morbidity and mortality were identified by data from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register and the Cause of Death Register through a retrospective register study of 104 sex-reassigned individuals. Results: Overall, 27.9\% of the sample were registered with psychiatric morbidity before SRS and 22.1\% after SRS (p = not significant). A total of 6.7\% of the sample were registered with psychiatric morbidity both before and after SRS. Significantly more psychiatric diagnoses were found before SRS for those assigned as female at birth. Ten individuals were registered as deceased post-SRS with an average age of death of 53.5 years. Conclusions: No significant difference in psychiatric morbidity or mortality was found between male to female and female to male (FtM) save for the total number of psychiatric diagnoses where FtM held a significantly higher number of psychiatric diagnoses overall. Despite the over-representation of psychiatric diagnoses both pre- and post-SRS the study found that only a relatively limited number of individuals had received diagnoses both prior to and after SRS. This suggests that generally SRS may reduce psychological morbidity for some individuals while increasing it for others.},

  abstract = {Transgender children and adolescents experience a gender identity that is incongruent with their sex assigned at birth, often resulting in gender dysphoria. Emerging literature has explored the etiology of transgender identities, documented transgender youths' risk for psychopathology, and evaluated whether social and medical gender transition processes are appropriate and effective for transgender youth. However, there is a dearth of empirical data on gender-affirmative psychological interventions designed to reduce the forms of psychological distress experienced by many transgender youths. This is surprising given the elevated rates of psychological distress among transgender youth and the broad recommendation for psychotherapy for youth going through a gender transition. To identify future directions in psychological interventions for transgender youth, we first review key background information on transgender youths' identity development and the role of psychological support in affirmative care. Next, we present future directions in this literature, which emphasizes the need for theory-driven empirical research that incorporates the developmental context of transgender youth to understand the mechanisms underlying group-specific psychological distress. Finally, we lay out the application of these future directions by exploring 3 domains relevant to transgender youth's psychological distress: gender dysphoria, parent and peer interactions, and co-occurring psychopathology. Within each domain, we review extant empirical research, present the current state of affirmative psychological interventions, and discuss implications for future directions. Future research on affirmative psychological care for transgender youth is urgently needed and must focus on clearly articulating which youth could benefit from psychological interventions and why those interventions might be effective.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing technology has become popular and widely used to study protein and DNA interactions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by sequencing of the resulting samples, produces large amounts of data that can be used to map genomic features such as transcription factor binding sites and histone modifications. METHODS: Our proposed statistical algorithm, BayesPeak, uses a fully Bayesian hidden Markov model to detect enriched locations in the genome. The structure accommodates the natural features of the Solexa/Illumina sequencing data and allows for overdispersion in the abundance of reads in different regions. Moreover, a control sample can be incorporated in the analysis to account for experimental and sequence biases. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are applied to estimate the posterior distributions of the model parameters, and posterior probabilities are used to detect the sites of interest. CONCLUSION: We have presented a flexible approach for identifying peaks from ChIP-seq reads, suitable for use on both transcription factor binding and histone modification data. Our method estimates probabilities of enrichment that can be used in downstream analysis. The method is assessed using experimentally verified data and is shown to provide high-confidence calls with low false positive rates.},

Method The sample consisted of 127 adolescents (79 boys, 48 girls), who were referred for GD in childhood ({$<$}12 years of age) and followed up in adolescence. We examined childhood differences among persisters and desisters in demographics, psychological functioning, quality of peer relations and childhood GD, and adolescent reports of GD, body image, and sexual orientation. We examined contributions of childhood factors on the probability of persistence of GD into adolescence. Results We found a link between the intensity of GD in childhood and persistence of GD, as well as a higher probability of persistence among natal girls. Psychological functioning and the quality of peer relations did not predict the persistence of childhood GD. Formerly nonsignificant (age at childhood assessment) and unstudied factors~(a cognitive and/or affective cross-gender identification and a social role transition) were~associated with the persistence of childhood GD, and varied among natal boys and girls. Conclusion Intensity of early GD appears to be an important predictor of persistence of GD. Clinical recommendations for the support of children with GD may need to be developed independently for natal boys and for girls, as the presentation of boys and girls with GD is different, and different factors are predictive for the persistence of GD.},

  abstract = {Introduction Several retrospective and prospective studies have reported on the association between childhood gender variance and sexual orientation and gender discomfort in adulthood. In most of the retrospective studies, samples were drawn from the general population. The samples in the prospective studies consisted of clinically referred children. In understanding the extent to which the association applies for the general population, prospective studies using random samples are needed. Aim This prospective study examined the association between childhood gender variance, and sexual orientation and gender discomfort in adulthood in the general population. Methods In 1983, we measured childhood gender variance, in 406 boys and 473 girls. In 2007, sexual orientation and gender discomfort were assessed. Main Outcome Measures Childhood gender variance was measured with two items from the Child Behavior Checklist/4\textendash 18. Sexual orientation was measured for four parameters of sexual orientation (attraction, fantasy, behavior, and identity). Gender discomfort was assessed by four questions (unhappiness and/or uncertainty about one's gender, wish or desire to be of the other gender, and consideration of living in the role of the other gender). Results For both men and women, the presence of childhood gender variance was associated with homosexuality for all four parameters of sexual orientation, but not with bisexuality. The report of adulthood homosexuality was 8 to 15 times higher for participants with a history of gender variance (10.2\% to 12.2\%), compared to participants without a history of gender variance (1.2\% to 1.7\%). The presence of childhood gender variance was not significantly associated with gender discomfort in adulthood. Conclusions This study clearly showed a significant association between childhood gender variance and a homosexual sexual orientation in adulthood in the general population. In contrast to the findings in clinically referred gender-variant children, the presence of a homosexual sexual orientation in adulthood was substantially lower.

We also compared these dimensions of identity in community youth to same dimensions among adolescent sex reassignment (SR) applicants. Most community youth scored high on the normative, cis-gender end of gender experience (median score 4.9 for boys and 4.9 for girls) and recalled fairly gender typical childhood behaviours and experiences. The girls displayed more gender non-conformity in childhood. Among the boys 2.2\% and among the girls 0.5\% displayed potentially clinically significant gender dysphoria on the GIDYQ-A. The community youth differed clearly from adolescent SR applicants on current and recalled childhood gender identity (SR applicants were 47, 6 natal boys and 41 natal girls, average ages were 16.4 years old (SD~=~0.93) and girls were on average 16.8 years old (SD~=~1.0).},

  abstract = {Double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase, has been implicated in the regulation or modulation of cell growth through multiple signaling pathways, but how PKR regulates tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced signaling pathways is poorly understood. In the present study, we used fibroblasts derived from PKR gene-deleted mice to investigate the role of PKR in TNF-induced activation of nuclear factor-B (NF-B), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and growth modulation. We found that in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF), TNF induced NF-B activation as measured by DNA binding but deletion of PKR abolished this activation. This inhibition was associated with suppression of inhibitory subunit of NF-B (IB) kinase (IKK) activation, IB phosphorylation and degradation, p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and NF-B-dependent reporter gene transcription. TNF-induced Akt activation needed for IKK activation was also abolished by deletion of PKR. NF-B activation was diminished in PKR-deleted cells transfected with TNF receptor (TNFR) 1, TNFR-associated death domain and TRAF2 plasmids; NF-B activated by NF-B-inducing kinase, IKK or p65, however, was minimally affected. Among the MAPKs, it was interesting that whereas TNF-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation was abolished, activation of p44/p42 MAPK and p38 MAPK was potentiated in PKR-deleted cells. TNF induced the expression of NF-B-regulated gene products cyclin D1, c-Myc, matrix metalloproteinase-9, survivin, X-linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (IAP), IAP1, Bcl-xL, A1/Bfl-1 and Fas-associated death domain protein-like IL-1-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein in wild-type MEF but not in PKR-/- cells. Similarly, TNF induced the proliferation of wild-type cells, but this proliferation was completely suppressed in PKR-deleted cells. Overall, our results indicate that PKR differentially regulates TNF signaling; IKK, Akt and JNK were positively regulated, whereas p44/p42 MAPK and p38 MAPK were negatively regulated.},

  abstract = {Ras plays a key role in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and transformation. Raf is the major effector of Ras in the Ras {$>$} Raf {$>$} Mek {$>$} extracellular signal-activated kinase (ERK) cascade. A second effector is phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase), which, in turn, activates the small G protein Rac. Rac also has multiple effectors, one of which is the serine threonine kinase Pak (p65(Pak)). Here we show that Ras, but not Raf, activates Pak1 in cotransfection assays of Rat-1 cells but not NIH 3T3 cells. We tested agents that activate or block specific components downstream of Ras and demonstrate a Ras {$>$} PI 3-kinase {$>$} Rac/Cdc42 {$>$} Pak signal. Although these studies  suggest that the signal from Ras through PI 3-kinase is sufficient to activate Pak, additional studies suggested that other effectors contribute to Pak activation. RasV12S35 and RasV12G37, two effector mutant proteins which fail to activate PI 3-kinase, did not activate Pak when tested alone but activated Pak when they were cotransfected. Similarly, RacV12H40, an effector mutant that does  not bind Pak, and Rho both cooperated with Raf to activate Pak. A dominant negative Rho mutant also inhibited Ras activation of Pak. All combinations of Rac/Raf and Ras/Raf and Rho/Raf effector mutants that transform cells cooperatively stimulated ERK. Cooperation was Pak dependent, since all combinations were inhibited by kinase-deficient Pak mutants in both transformation assays and ERK activation assays. These data suggest that other Ras effectors can collaborate with PI 3-kinase and with each other to activate Pak. Furthermore, the strong correlation between Pak activation and cooperative transformation suggests that Pak activation is necessary, although not sufficient, for cooperative transformation of Rat-1 fibroblasts by Ras, Rac, and  Rho.},

  abstract = {Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas--the most common type of adult brain cancer--and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications.

  abstract = {Genetic changes underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) include alterations in genes controlling cellular oxygen sensing (for example, VHL) and the maintenance of chromatin states (for example, PBRM1). We surveyed more than 400 tumours using different genomic platforms and identified 19 significantly mutated genes. The PI(3)K/AKT pathway was recurrently mutated, suggesting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Widespread DNA hypomethylation was associated with mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2, and integrative analysis suggested that mutations involving the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex (PBRM1, ARID1A, SMARCA4) could have far-reaching effects on other pathways. Aggressive cancers demonstrated evidence of a metabolic shift, involving downregulation of genes involved in the TCA cycle, decreased AMPK and PTEN protein levels, upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutamine transporter genes, increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase protein, and altered promoter methylation of miR-21 (also known as MIR21) and GRB10. Remodelling cellular metabolism thus constitutes a recurrent pattern in ccRCC that correlates with tumour stage and severity and offers new views on the opportunities for disease treatment.},

Epigenetic profiles showed substantial heterogeneity, including an IDH1 mutant subset with a methylator phenotype. Androgen receptor (AR) activity varied widely and in a subtype-specific manner, with SPOP and FOXA1 mutant tumors having the highest levels of AR-induced transcripts. 25\% of the prostate cancers had a presumed actionable lesion in the PI3K or MAPK signaling pathways, and DNA repair genes were inactivated in 19\%. Our analysis reveals molecular heterogeneity among primary prostate cancers, as well as potentially actionable molecular defects.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence indicates transgender adolescents (TGAs) exhibit elevated rates of suicidal ideation and attempt compared with cisgender adolescents (CGAs). Less is known about risk among subgroups of TGAs because of limited measures of gender identity in previous studies. We examined disparities in suicidality across the full spectrum of suicidality between TGAs and CGAs and examined risk for suicidality within TGA subgroups. METHODS: Adolescents aged 14 to 18 completed a cross-sectional online survey (N = 2020, including 1148 TGAs). Participants reported gender assigned at birth and current gender identity (categorized as cisgender males, cisgender females, transgender males, transgender females, nonbinary adolescents assigned female at birth, nonbinary adolescents assigned male at birth, and questioning gender identity). Lifetime suicidality (passive death wish, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt, and attempt requiring medical care) and nonsuicidal self-injury were assessed. RESULTS: Aggregated into 1 group, TGAs had higher odds of all outcomes as compared with CGAs. Within TGA subgroups, transgender males and transgender females had higher odds of suicidal ideation and attempt than CGA groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we used comprehensive measures of gender assigned at birth and current gender identity within a large nationwide survey of adolescents in the United States to examine suicidality among TGAs and CGAs. TGAs had higher odds of all suicidality outcomes, and transgender males and transgender females had high risk for suicidal ideation and attempt. Authors of future adolescent suicidality research must assess both gender assigned at birth and current gender identity to accurately identify and categorize TGAs.},

Since reconsolidation impairment has been proposed as a treatment for mental disorders that have at their core an emotional memory, it is desirable to understand how to reliably reduce the strength of pathogenic memories in humans. We postulated that since humans (unlike experimental animals) typically receive propranolol orally, this introduces a delay before this drug can exert its memory impairment effects, which may render it less effective. As a means to test this, in two double-blind placebo-controlled experiments, we examined the capacity of propranolol to impair consolidation and reconsolidation as a function of timing of ingestion in healthy subjects. In Experiment 1, (n=36), propranolol administered immediately after learning or recall failed to impair the consolidation or reconsolidation of the memory of a standardized slideshow with an accompanying emotional story. In Experiment 2 (n=50), propranolol given 60-75min before learning or recall successfully impaired memory consolidation and reconsolidation. These results suggest that it is possible to achieve reliable memory impairment in humans if propranolol is given before learning or before recall, but not after.},

  abstract = {Single-cell expression profiles of melanoma Tumors harbor multiple cell types that are thought to play a role in the development of resistance to drug treatments. Tirosh et al. used single-cell sequencing to investigate the distribution of these differing genetic profiles within melanomas. Many cells harbored heterogeneous genetic programs that reflected two different states of genetic expression, one of which was linked to resistance development. Following drug treatment, the resistance-linked expression state was found at a much higher level. Furthermore, the environment of the melanoma cells affected their gene expression programs. Science, this issue p. 189 To explore the distinct genotypic and phenotypic states of melanoma tumors, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to 4645 single cells isolated from 19 patients, profiling malignant, immune, stromal, and endothelial cells. Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies. Melanoma cells show transcriptional heterogeneity. Melanoma cells show transcriptional heterogeneity.},

In the UK, sterilisation has never been a legal requirement for trans people. However, hysterectomy and salpingo-oopherectomy have been strongly encouraged for trans masculine people on medical grounds, although the clinical evidence for current recommendations is weak. Within this article I analyse the issue from a feminist perspective and argue that current presumptions in favour of surgical intervention are influenced by the history of medical interventions to ``fix'' bodies perceived as female, coupled with a strong social taboo against the pregnant man. As a consequence, medical and legal frameworks are not necessarily facilitating optimal outcomes for the individual. I suggest that practices in this regard should be critically examined, with a view to developing more tailored, person-centred practices and facilitating informed choice.},

  abstract = {Although there is accumulated evidence of a role for Notch in the developing lung, it is still unclear how disruption of Notch signaling affects lung progenitor cell fate and differentiation events in the airway epithelium. To address this issue, we inactivated Notch signaling conditionally in the endoderm using a Shh-Cre deleter mouse line and mice carrying floxed alleles of the Pofut1 gene, which encodes an O-fucosyltransferase essential for Notch-ligand binding. We also took the same conditional approach to inactivate expression of Rbpjk, which encodes the transcriptional effector of canonical Notch signaling. Strikingly, these mutants showed an almost identical lung phenotype characterized by an absence of secretory Clara cells without evidence of cell death, and showed airways populated essentially by ciliated cells, with an increase in neuroendocrine cells. This phenotype could be further replicated in cultured wild-type lungs by disrupting Notch signaling with a gamma-secretase inhibitor. Our data suggest that Notch acts when commitment to a ciliated or non-ciliated cell fate occurs in proximal progenitors, silencing the ciliated program in the cells that will continue to expand and differentiate into secretory cells. This mechanism may be crucial to define the balance of differentiated cell profiles in different generations of the developing airways. It might also be relevant to mediate the metaplastic changes in the respiratory epithelium that occur in pathological conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.},

This article reviews terminology in this evolving field, traditional models of gender identity development and their limitations, epidemiology and natural history of cross-gender identification among children and adolescents, co-occurring conditions and behaviors, research into the biological and psychosocial determinants of cross-gender identification, and research into the options regarding and benefits of clinical approaches to gender incongruent youth. Methods Based on a critical review of the extant literature, both theoretical and empirical, that addresses the issue of pediatric gender identity, the authors synthesized what is presently known and what is in need of further research in order to elucidate the developmental trajectory and clinical needs of gender diverse youth. Results The field of pediatric gender identity has evolved substantially over the past several years. New research suggests that cross-gender identification is prevalent (approximately 1\% of youth). These youth suffer disproportionately high rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidality. Although research into the etiology of cross-gender identification is limited, emerging data have shown that affirmative treatment protocols may improve the high rates of mental health difficulties seen among these patients. Conclusions The field of pediatric gender identity has evolved dramatically. Emerging data suggest that these patients' high rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidality appear to be improved with affirmative protocols, although future longitudinal data are needed.},

  abstract = {Author Summary During cell death, DNA that is not contained within a membrane (i.e., cell-free DNA) enters the circulation. Detecting cell-free DNA originating from solid tumors (i.e., circulating tumor DNA, ctDNA), particularly solid tumors that have not metastasized, has proven challenging due to the relatively abundant background of normally occurring cell-free DNA derived from healthy cells. Our study defines the subtle but distinct differences in fragment length between normal cell-free DNA and ctDNA from a variety of solid tumors. Specifically, ctDNA was overall consistently shorter than the fragment length of normal cell-free DNA. Subsequently, we showed that a size-selection for shorter cell-free DNA fragments increased the proportion of ctDNA within a sample. These results provide compelling evidence that development of techniques to isolate a subset of cell-free DNA consistent with the ctDNA fragment lengths described in our study may substantially improve detection of non-metastatic solid tumors. As such, our findings may have a direct impact on the clinical utility of ctDNA for the non-invasive detection and diagnosis of solid tumors (i.e., the ``liquid biopsy''), monitoring tumor recurrence, and evaluating tumor response to therapy.},

  abstract = {Background Healthcare professionals are crucial in the identification and accessibility to treatment for people with substance use disorders. Our objective was to assess health professionals' attitudes towards patients with substance use disorders and examine the consequences of these attitudes on healthcare delivery for these patients in Western countries. Methods Pubmed, PsycINFO and Embase were systematically searched for articles published between 2000 and 2011. Studies evaluating health professionals' attitudes towards patients with substance use disorders and consequences of negative attitudes were included. An inclusion criterion was that studies addressed alcohol or illicit drug abuse. Reviews, commentaries and letters were excluded, as were studies originating from non-Western countries. Results The search process yielded 1562 citations. After selection and quality assessment, 28 studies were included. Health professionals generally had a negative attitude towards patients with substance use disorders. They perceived violence, manipulation, and poor motivation as impeding factors in the healthcare delivery for these patients. Health professionals also lacked adequate education, training and support structures in working with this patient group. Negative attitudes of health professionals diminished patients' feelings of empowerment and subsequent treatment outcomes. Health professionals are less involved and have a more task-oriented approach in the delivery of healthcare, resulting in less personal engagement and diminished empathy. Conclusions This review indicates that negative attitudes of health professionals towards patients with substance use disorders are common and contribute to suboptimal health care for these patients. However, few studies have evaluated the consequences of health professionals' negative attitudes towards patients with substance use disorders.},

Three studies have taken the inverse approach in children with ASD and showed increased parent report of the wish to be of the opposite gender in this group. This study compared the self-reported wish to be of the opposite gender (one item of the Youth Self-Report [YSR] and the Adult Self-Report [ASR]) of 573 adolescents (469 assigned boys and 104 assigned girls) and 807 adults (616 assigned males and 191 assigned females) with ASD to 1016 adolescents and 846 adults from the general population. Emotional and behavioral problems were measured by the DSM-oriented scales of the YSR and ASR. In addition, the Children's Social Behavior Questionnaire and the Adult Social Behavior Questionnaire were used to measure specific subdomains of the ASD spectrum to test whether specific subdomains of ASD were particularly involved. Significantly more adolescents (6.5\%) and adults (11.4\%) with ASD endorsed this item as compared to the general population (3-5\%). In adolescents, assigned girls endorsed this item more than assigned boys. No significant gender differences were found in the adults with ASD. In addition, on all DSM-oriented scales of both the YSR and ASR, adolescents and adults with ASD who endorsed the gender item had significantly higher scores compared to those without. There were no significant associations between endorsement of the gender item and any specific subdomain of ASD, providing no evidence for a sole role of one of the ASD subdomains and endorsement of the wish to be the opposite gender.},

  abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has caused a revolution in biology. NGS requires the preparation of libraries in which (fragments of) DNA or RNA molecules are fused with adapters followed by PCR amplification and sequencing. It is evident that robust library preparation methods that produce a representative, non-biased source of nucleic acid material from the genome under investigation are of crucial importance. Nevertheless, it has become clear that NGS libraries for all  types of applications contain biases that compromise the quality of NGS datasets  and can lead to their erroneous interpretation. A detailed knowledge of the nature of these biases will be essential for a careful interpretation of NGS data on the one hand and will help to find ways to improve library quality or to develop bioinformatics tools to compensate for the bias on the other hand. In this review we discuss the literature on bias in the most common NGS library preparation protocols, both for DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) as well as for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Strikingly, almost all steps of the various protocols have  been reported to introduce bias, especially in the case of RNA-seq, which is technically more challenging than DNA-seq. For each type of bias we discuss methods for improvement with a view to providing some useful advice to the researcher who wishes to convert any kind of raw nucleic acid into an NGS library.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Given that self-perceptions of mental and physical health are important predictors of health outcomes and well-being, particularly among older adults, this study focuses on associations among age, alcohol consumption, and indicators of both self-rated mental health and self-rated physical health in a sample of sexual minority women (SMW). METHODS: This study uses a community sample of SMW to examine the associations among age, drinking, and self-rated mental and physical health. RESULTS: Heavy drinking among older adult SMW (55+) was less prevalent than among young SMW, ages 18-25 and ages 26-39, but similar to rates reported among SMW ages 40-54. In addition, older SMW reported significantly higher levels of self-rated mental health, compared with SMW in the other age groups, but we found no significant associations between age and self-rated physical health. Across all age groups, moderate drinkers reported better self-rated physical health than alcohol abstainers. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that, among SMW, drinking does not decline as sharply with age as it does for heterosexual women in the general population. Given the current and projected increases in the aging population and the risks that heavy drinking presents for morbidity and mortality, interventions aimed at older SMW are needed.},

  abstract = {What's in a drop of blood? Blood contains many types of cells, including many immune system components. Immune cells used to be characterized by marker-based assays, but now classification relies on the genes that cells express. Villani et al. used deep sequencing at the single-cell level and unbiased clustering to define six dendritic cell and four monocyte populations. This refined analysis has identified, among others, a previously unknown dendritic cell population that potently activates T cells. Further cell culture revealed possible differentiation progenitors within the different cell populations. Science, this issue p. eaah4573 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONDendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes consist of multiple specialized subtypes that play a central role in pathogen sensing, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation. However, their identities and interrelationships are not fully understood, as these populations have historically been defined by a combination of morphology, physical properties, localization, functions, developmental origins, and expression of a restricted set of surface markers. RATIONALETo overcome this inherently biased strategy for cell identification, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of \textasciitilde 2400 cells isolated from healthy blood donors and enriched for HLA-DR+ lineage- cells. This single-cell profiling strategy and unbiased genomic classification, together with follow-up profiling and functional and phenotypic characterization of prospectively isolated subsets, led us to identify and validate six DC subtypes and four monocyte subtypes, and thus revise the taxonomy of these cells. RESULTSOur study reveals: 1) A new DC subset, representing 2 to 3\% of the DC populations across all 10 donors tested, characterized by the expression of AXL, SIGLEC1, and SIGLEC6 antigens, named AS DCs. The AS DC population further divides into two populations captured in the traditionally defined plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and CD1C+ conventional DC (cDC) gates. This split is further reflected through AS DC gene expression signatures spanning a spectrum between cDC-like and pDC-like gene sets. Although AS DCs share properties with pDCs, they more potently activate T cells. This discovery led us to reclassify pDCs as the originally described ``natural interferon-producing cells (IPCs)'' with weaker T cell proliferation induction ability.2) A new subdivision within the CD1C+ DC subset: one defined by a major histocompatibility complex class II\textendash like gene set and one by a CD14+ monocyte\textendash like prominent gene set. These CD1C+ DC subsets, which can be enriched by combining CD1C with CD32B, CD36, and CD163 antigens, can both potently induce T cell proliferation.3) The existence of a circulating and dividing cDC progenitor giving rise to CD1C+ and CLEC9A+ DCs through in vitro differentiation assays. This blood precursor is defined by the expression of CD100+CD34int and observed at a frequency of \textasciitilde 0.02\% of the LIN\textendash HLA-DR+ fraction.4) Two additional monocyte populations: one expressing classical monocyte genes and cytotoxic genes, and the other with unknown functions.5) Evidence for a relationship between blastic plasmacytoid DC neoplasia (BPDCN) cells and healthy DCs. CONCLUSIONOur revised taxonomy will enable more accurate functional and developmental analyses as well as immune monitoring in health and disease. The discovery of AS DCs within the traditionally defined pDC population explains many of the cDC properties previously assigned to pDCs, highlighting the need to revisit the definition of pDCs. Furthermore, the discovery of blood cDC progenitors represents a new therapeutic target readily accessible in the bloodstream for manipulation, as well as a new source for better in vitro DC generation. Although the current results focus on DCs and monocytes, a similar strategy can be applied to build a comprehensive human immune cell atlas. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/356/6335/eaah4573/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Establishing a human blood monocyte and dendritic cell atlas.We isolated \textasciitilde 2400 cells enriched from the healthy human blood lineage- HLA-DR+ compartment and subjected them to single-cell RNA sequencing. This strategy, together with follow-up profiling and functional and phenotypic characterization, led us to update the original cell classification to include six DCs, four monocyte subtypes, and one conventional DC progenitor. Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play a central role in pathogen sensing, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation and consist of multiple specialized subtypes. However, their identities and interrelationships are not fully understood. Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of \textasciitilde 2400 cells, we identified six human DCs and four monocyte subtypes in human blood. Our study reveals a new DC subset that shares properties with plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) but potently activates T cells, thus redefining pDCs; a new subdivision within the CD1C+ subset of DCs; the relationship between blastic plasmacytoid DC neoplasia cells and healthy DCs; and circulating progenitor of conventional DCs (cDCs). Our revised taxonomy will enable more accurate functional and developmental analyses as well as immune monitoring in health and disease. Discovery of additional immune cell subtypes will help identify functions and immune monitoring during disease.

Whilst interest and ethical standards have both risen, there remains little specific methodological consideration of research with transgender participants. This article draws on practical experiences of doing research with transgender communities, and insider group status, to construct six categories to consider when working on trans-focused research. These categories include the importance of transgender history, the assurance of transparency, the significance of nuanced language use, the benefits of feminist methodological contributions, the value of intersectionality and the necessity of respecting trans spaces. The article concludes by reflecting on the overlapping and non-exhaustive nature of these categories, and wider structural concerns that may trouble knowledge production more generally.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, the attention for health literacy has increased in the European Union. This is due to three main reasons. First, reviews have shown that inadequate health literacy is associated with worse health outcomes, higher health care use and expenditure. Second, in all European countries the population is aging and the number of chronically ill people is rising. Improving health literacy in this group can offer greater opportunities to take an active part in society, be independent and improve quality of life. Third, since most research on health literacy has been conducted outside Europe and relatively little is known about the development of health literacy interventions and its effects on outcome measures in European countries. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence on the effectiveness of health literacy interventions in the European Union published between 1995 and 2018.},

  abstract = {Purpose The Endocrine Society and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health published guidelines for the treatment of adolescents with gender dysphoria (GD). The guidelines recommend the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists in adolescence to suppress puberty. However, in actual practice, no consensus exists whether to use these early medical interventions. The aim of this study was to explicate the considerations of proponents and opponents of puberty suppression in GD to move forward the ethical debate. Methods Qualitative study (semi-structured interviews and open-ended questionnaires) to identify considerations of proponents and opponents of early treatment (pediatric endocrinologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, ethicists) of 17 treatment teams worldwide. Results Seven themes give rise to different, and even opposing, views on treatment: (1) the (non-)availability of an explanatory model for GD; (2) the nature of GD (normal variation, social construct or [mental] illness); (3) the role of physiological puberty in developing gender identity; (4) the role of comorbidity; (5) possible physical or psychological effects of (refraining from) early medical interventions; (6) child competence and decision making authority; and (7) the role of social context how GD is perceived. Strikingly, the guidelines are debated both for being too liberal and for being too limiting. Nevertheless, many treatment teams using the guidelines are exploring the possibility of lowering the current age limits. Conclusions As long as debate remains on these seven themes and only limited long-term data are available, there will be no consensus on treatment. Therefore, more systematic interdisciplinary and (worldwide) multicenter research is required.},

  abstract = {The accurate mapping of reads that span splice junctions is a critical component of all analytic techniques that work with RNA-seq data. We introduce a second generation splice detection algorithm, MapSplice, whose focus is high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of splices as well as CPU and memory efficiency. MapSplice can be applied to both short ({$<$}75 bp) and long reads ({$\geq$} 75 bp). MapSplice is not dependent on splice site features or intron length, consequently it can detect novel canonical as well as non-canonical splices. MapSplice leverages the quality and diversity of read alignments of a given splice to increase accuracy. We demonstrate that MapSplice achieves higher sensitivity and specificity than TopHat and SpliceMap on a set of simulated RNA-seq data. Experimental studies also support the accuracy of the algorithm. Splice junctions derived from eight breast cancer RNA-seq datasets recapitulated the extensiveness of alternative splicing on a global level as well as the differences between molecular subtypes of breast cancer. These combined results indicate that MapSplice is a highly accurate algorithm for the alignment of RNA-seq reads to splice junctions.

The following is a guest post* by three philosophers who wish to remain anonymous (though their identity is known to me). Recognizing Gender Critical Feminism as Anti-Trans Activism by three anonymous philosophers A recent letter~published at~Inside Higher Education argues that we should not censure writings by so-called ``gender-critical'' philosophers. We agree with the authors of the letter that philosophy should be ``a discipline in which sensitive and controversial issues are investigated with patience, care and insight.'' But ``gender-critical'' writings, which the letter defends, do not advance us toward this ideal. The current crop of trans-exclusionary ``gender-critical'' philosophers is first and foremost an activist movement. Their writings and behavior are best understood as aimed at achieving their activist ends, such as preventing trans women from using facilities designated for women, or making it more difficult for trans women to be legally recognized as women. Like other activists, they will denigrate or vilify their opponents, make use of dogwhistles, appeal to people's baser emotions to increase support for their cause, and ignore inconvenient facts. Far from being worthwhile contributions to a scholarly discussion, their writings rehash discredited claims from the 1980s (if not earlier), express demeaning and offensive ideas about trans people, and inhibit truly careful, critical, and thoughtful scholarly debate. We don't want to advance a view about the correct way to respond to these writings. We understand the worry that suppressing them could do more harm than good. Our main point is that readers need to understand that the central problem is not how to uplift the message of ``gender-critical'' voices, but how to understand them as activists, and how to manage content that is disrespectful, fear-mongering, and misleading, while avoiding harm to the scholarly community. One problem is that it's easy to miss the transphobia in trans-exclusionary writing, because it's often cloaked in a veneer of politeness and ordinary language, while in fact functioning as a `dogwhistle'. Dogwhistles are covert political..},

Unfortunately, these inequalities are on the rise in many countries, including welfare states. Various theories have been offered to explain the persistence (and rise) of these inequalities over time, including the social determinants of health and fundamental cause theory. Interestingly, the rise of modern social inequalities in health has come at a time of great technological innovation. This article addresses whether these technological innovations are significantly influencing the persistence of modern social inequalities in health. A theoretical argument is offered for this potential connection and is discussed alongside the typical social determinants of health perspective and the increasingly popular fundamental cause perspective. This is followed by a proposed research agenda for further investigation of the potential role that technological innovations may play in influencing social inequalities in health.},

Current understanding of VF wound healing is hindered by a paucity of data and is therefore often generalized from research conducted in skin and other mucosal systems. Here, using a previously validated rat injury model, expression microarray technology and an empirical Bayes analysis approach, we generated a VF-specific transcriptome dataset to better capture the system-level complexity of wound healing in this specialized tissue. We measured differential gene expression at 3, 14 and 60 days post-injury compared to experimentally na\"ive controls, pursued functional enrichment analyses to refine and add greater biological definition to the previously proposed temporal phases of VF wound healing, and validated the expression and localization of a subset of previously unidentified repair- and regeneration-related genes at the protein level. Our microarray dataset is a resource for the wider research community and has the potential to stimulate new hypotheses and avenues of investigation, improve biological and mechanistic insight, and accelerate the identification of novel therapeutic targets.},

This implies that the nucleosomal DNA content is preferentially quantized, which in turn implies that linker DNA lengths are preferentially quantized. This study confirms and extends previous observations in the literature that had suggested, but not firmly established, that linker lengths might be quantized. The quantization of repeat lengths applies even for very long repeat lengths. This suggests a model for the origin of the quantization, in which the quantization arises from the requirements of higher-order chromatin structure.},

Here we have sought to investigate which chromatin remodelling enzymes are responsible for this. We find that the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzyme SNF2H plays a major role organising arrays of nucleosomes adjacent to the binding sites for the architectural transcription factor CTCF sites and acts to promote CTCF binding. At many other factor binding sites SNF2H and the related enzyme SNF2L contribute  to nucleosome organisation. The action of SNF2H at CTCF sites is functionally important as depletion of CTCF or SNF2H affects transcription of a common group of genes. This suggests that chromatin remodelling ATPase's most closely related  to the Drosophila ISWI protein contribute to the function of many human gene regulatory elements.},

Advances in data acquisition from electronic patient records (EPRs) means such data are increasingly digital and can be anonymised for research purposes. NHS England's care.data initiative recently sought to increase the amount and availability of such data. However, controversy and uncertainty following the care.data public awareness campaign led to a delay in rollout, indicating that the success of EPR data for medical research may be threatened by a loss of patient and public trust. The sharing of sensitive health care data can only be done through maintaining such trust in a constantly evolving ethicolegal and political landscape. We propose that a dynamic consent model, whereby patients can electronically control consent through time and receive information about the uses of their data, provides a transparent, flexible, and user-friendly means to maintain public trust. This could leverage the huge potential of the EPR for medical research and, ultimately, patient and societal benefit.},

  abstract = {Introduction The construction of reliable, reusable clinical code sets is essential when re-using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for research. Yet code set definitions are rarely transparent and their sharing is almost non-existent. There is a lack of methodological standards for the management (construction, sharing, revision and reuse) of clinical code sets which needs to be addressed to ensure the reliability and credibility of studies which use code sets. Objective To review methodological literature on the management of sets of clinical codes used in research on clinical databases and to provide a list of best practice recommendations for future studies and software tools. Methods We performed an exhaustive search for methodological papers about clinical code set engineering for re-using EHR data in research. This was supplemented with papers identified by snowball sampling. In addition, a list of e-phenotyping systems was constructed by merging references from several systematic reviews on this topic, and the processes adopted by those systems for code set management was reviewed. Results Thirty methodological papers were reviewed. Common approaches included: creating an initial list of synonyms for the condition of interest (n=20); making use of the hierarchical nature of coding terminologies during searching (n=23); reviewing sets with clinician input (n=20); and reusing and updating an existing code set (n=20). Several open source software tools (n=3) were discovered. Discussion There is a need for software tools that enable users to easily and quickly create, revise, extend, review and share code sets and we provide a list of recommendations for their design and implementation. Conclusion Research re-using EHR data could be improved through the further development, more widespread use and routine reporting of the methods by which clinical codes were selected.},

  abstract = {Motivation: We introduce gmap, a standalone program for mapping and aligning cDNA sequences to a genome. The program maps and aligns a single sequence with minimal startup time and memory requirements, and provides fast batch processing of large sequence sets. The program generates accurate gene structures, even in the presence of substantial polymorphisms and sequence errors, without using probabilistic splice site models. Methodology underlying the program includes a minimal sampling strategy for genomic mapping, oligomer chaining for approximate alignment, sandwich DP for splice site detection, and microexon identification with statistical significance testing.Results: On a set of human messenger RNAs with random mutations at a 1 and 3\% rate, gmap identified all splice sites accurately in over 99.3\% of the sequences, which was one-tenth the error rate of existing programs. On a large set of human expressed sequence tags, gmap provided higher-quality alignments more often than blat did. On a set of Arabidopsis cDNAs, gmap performed comparably with GeneSeqer. In these experiments, gmap demonstrated a several-fold increase in speed over existing programs.Availability: Source code for gmap and associated programs is available at http://www.gene.com/share/gmapContact: twu@gene.comSupplementary information: http://www.gene.com/share/gmap},

  abstract = {Motivation: Next-generation sequencing captures sequence differences in reads relative to a reference genome or transcriptome, including splicing events and complex variants involving multiple mismatches and long indels. We present computational methods for fast detection of complex variants and splicing in short reads, based on a successively constrained search process of merging and filtering position lists from a genomic index. Our methods are implemented in GSNAP (Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program), which can align both single- and paired-end reads as short as 14 nt and of arbitrarily long length. It can detect short- and long-distance splicing, including interchromosomal splicing, in individual reads, using probabilistic models or a database of known splice sites. Our program also permits SNP-tolerant alignment to a reference space of all possible combinations of major and minor alleles, and can align reads from bisulfite-treated DNA for the study of methylation state.Results: In comparison testing, GSNAP has speeds comparable to existing programs, especially in reads of {$\geq$}70 nt and is fastest in detecting complex variants with four or more mismatches or insertions of 1\textendash 9 nt and deletions of 1\textendash 30 nt. Although SNP tolerance does not increase alignment yield substantially, it affects alignment results in 7\textendash 8\% of transcriptional reads, typically by revealing alternate genomic mappings for a read. Simulations of bisulfite-converted DNA show a decrease in identifying genomic positions uniquely in 6\% of 36 nt reads and 3\% of 70 nt reads.Availability: Source code in C and utility programs in Perl are freely available for download as part of the GMAP package at http://share.gene.com/gmap.Contact: twu@gene.com},

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is increasingly used to map chromatin states and to functionally annotate the genome. Many ChIP-Seq profiles, especially those of histone methylations, are noisy and diffuse. Here we describe SICER (Zang et al., Bioinformatics 25(15):1952\textendash 1958, 2009), an algorithm specifically designed to identify disperse ChIP-enriched regions with high sensitivity and specificity. This algorithm has found a lot of applications in epigenomic studies. In this Chapter, we will demonstrate in detail how to run SICER to delineate ChIP-enriched regions and assess their statistical significance, and to identify regions of differential enrichment when two chromatin states are compared.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic cells transcribe a vast number of noncoding RNA species. Among them, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely implicated in the regulation of gene transcription. However, examples of post-transcriptional gene regulation by lncRNAs are emerging. For example, through extended base-pairing, lncRNAs can stabilize or promote the translation of target mRNAs, while partial base-pairing facilitates mRNA decay or inhibits target mRNA translation. In the absence of complementarity, lncRNAs can suppress pre-mRNA splicing and translation by acting as decoys of RNA-binding proteins or microRNAs, and can compete for microRNA-mediated inhibition leading to increased expression of the mRNA. Through these regulatory mechanisms, lncRNAs can elicit differentiation, proliferation, and cytoprotective programs, underscoring the rising recognition of lncRNA roles in human disease. In this review, we summarize the mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation by lncRNAs.},

  abstract = {This review provides an update on the epidemiology of gender dysphoria and transgender identity in children, adolescents and adults. Although the prevalence of gender dysphoria, as it is operationalised in the fifth edtion of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), remains a relatively `rare' or `uncommon' diagnosis, there is evidence that it has increased in the past couple of decades, perhaps reflected in the large increase in referral rates to specialised gender identity clinics. In childhood, the sex ratio continues to favour birth-assigned males, but in adolescents, there has been a recent inversion in the sex ratio from one favouring birth-assigned males to one favouring birth-assigned females. In both adolescents and adults, patterns of sexual orientation vary as a function of birth-assigned sex. Recent studies suggest that the prevalence of a self-reported transgender identity in children, adolescents and adults ranges from 0.5 to 1.3\%, markedly higher than prevalence rates based on clinic-referred samples of adults. The stability of a self-reported transgender identity or a gender identity that departs from the traditional male\textendash female binary among non-clinic-based populations remains unknown and requires further study.},
